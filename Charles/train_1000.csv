1,How to check if an uploaded file is an image without mime type?,"<p>I'd like to check if an uploaded file is an image file (e.g png, jpg, jpeg, gif, bmp) or another file. The problem is that I'm using Uploadify to upload the files, which changes the mime type and gives a 'text/octal' or something as the mime type, no matter which file type you upload.</p>

<p>Is there a way to check if the uploaded file is an image apart from checking the file extension using PHP?</p>

2,How can I prevent firefox from closing when I press ctrl-w,"<p>In my favorite editor (vim), I regularly use ctrl-w to execute a certain action. Now, it quite often happens to me that firefox is the active window (on windows) while I still look at vim (thinking vim is the active window) and press ctrl-w which closes firefox. This is not what I want. Is there a way to stop ctrl-w from closing firefox?</p>

3,R Error Invalid type (list) for variable,"<p>I am import matlab file and construct a data frame, matlab file contains two columns with and each row maintain a cell that has a matrix, I construct a dataframe to run random forest. But I am getting following error. </p>

<pre><code>Error in model.frame.default(formula = expert_data_frame$t_labels ~ .,  : 
  invalid type (list) for variable 'expert_data_frame$t_labels'

<p>Here is the code how I import the matlab file and construct the dataframe:</p>

<pre><code>all_exp_traintest &lt;- readMat(all_exp_filepath);
len = length(all_exp_traintest$exp.traintest)/2;
    for (i in 1:len) {
      expert_train_df &lt;- data.frame(all_exp_traintest$exp.traintest[i]);
      labels = data.frame(all_exp_traintest$exp.traintest[i+302]);
      names(labels)[1] &lt;- ""t_labels"";
      expert_train_df$t_labels &lt;- labels;

8,How to fetch an XML feed using asp.net,"<p>I've decided to convert a Windows Phone 7 app that fetches an XML feed and then parses it to an asp.net web app, using Visual Web Developer Express. I figure since the code already works for WP7, it should be a matter of mostly copying and pasting it for the C# code behind. </p>

<pre><code>HttpWebRequest request = HttpWebRequest.CreateHttp(""http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=routeConfig&amp;a=sf-muni&amp;r="" + line1);
</code></pre>

<p>That's the first line of code from my WP7 app that fetches the XML feed, but I can't even get HttpWebRequest to work in Visual Web Developer like that. Intellisense shows a create and createdefault, but no CreateHttp like there was in Windows Phone 7. I just need to figure out how to fetch the page, I assume the parsing will be the same as on my phone app. Any help?</p>

<p>As stated in numerous threads here, someone with enough motivation/time/skill will always find a way to read your code (aka if it's runnable, it's decompilable), but it seems to me that most casual code readers won't bother decompiling my code if Reflector can't do it for them.</p>

12,Crappy Random Number Generator,"<p>This may sound like an odd question, but where can I find a random number generator that works in C or C++ that is not very good?</p>

<p>Context: I'm creating some tree graph plotting software and testing it by using multi-digit random numbers (so each digit becomes a node in the tree). The random number generator I've been using - which is the one that comes with the GNU C++ compiler - gives me a nice spread of values. That's good, but I want to see how the table looks when the numbers clump together and are less homogenous. </p>

16,PHP framework URL conventions,"<p>A lot of frameworks use URL conventions like <code>/controller/action/{id}</code> which is great, but if you need any configuration beyond that, it's up to you to write your own routes.</p>

<p>How would you handle URLs like <code>/users/{id}/friends</code> on the backend? (to list all of a user's friends)</p>

<p>I'm thinking that in the controller, something like this would be appropriate:</p>

<pre><code>class User {
    function index() {
        echo 'user index';
    }
}

class Friend extends User {
    function index($user_id) {
        echo 'friend index';
    }    
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you would have the following map:</p>

<pre><code>/users              -&gt; User::index()
/users/{id}         -&gt; User::view($id)
/users/{id}/friends -&gt; Friend::index($user_id)
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted to put the Friend class inside the User class but apparently you can't do that in PHP so this is the best I could come up with. Thoughts?</p>

<p>What URL would use for editing your list of friends? <code>/users/{id}/friends/edit</code> could work, but it doesn't seem appropriate, since you should never be editing someone else's friend list. Would <code>/account/friends/edit</code> be a better choice? Where would you put the corresponding code for that? In a friend controller, or a user controller, or a specialized account controller?</p>

<p>Bonus question: which do you prefer? <code>/photos/delete/{id}</code> or <code>/photos/{id}/delete</code></p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p><strong>The answers:</strong></p>

<p>So, what I've gathered from the answers is that if the ""thing"" is complicated (like ""friends"") but doesn't have its own controller, you can give it one without a model, or if it's not, you should stuff it in with whatever it's most closely related to. Your URLs should not influence where you put your code. Most people seem to think you should stick to <code>/controller/action/{id}</code> whever possible, because it's what people are familiar with.</p>

<p>No one really commented on the extended class aside from saying it's ""awkward"". Perhaps FriendList would have been a more appropriate class in that case if I really wanted to separate it out.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the answers :)</p>

<hr>

<p>I ran across the movie <a href=""http://cutpoisonburn.com/"">Cut Poison Burn</a>, who's abstract is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cut Poison Burn is a controversial, eye opening, and sometimes heartbreaking documentary that puts the business of cancer treatment under the microscope. Follow the frustrating journeys of critically ill cancer patients as they try to navigate the confusing and dangerous maze of treatment and encounter formidable obstacles in the “cancer industrial complex.”  A compelling critique of the influence of medical monopolies, the power of pharmaceutical companies and government agencies, Cut Poison Burn is essential viewing for anyone and everyone touched by cancer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The movie may advocate (haven't watched the whole thing) some kind of new, pennies-per-session treatment a la <a href=""http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/4611/does-burzynski-have-a-miracle-cancer-cure-being-suppressed-by-the-fda"">Burzynski</a>, or at least <a href=""http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/09/19/cut-poison-burn.aspx"">Dr. Mercola is using it to do so</a>.</p>

<p>There are a myriad of claims in the movie, I'm sure (I only watched the first 10min), but I'd like to address one in particular that struck me (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/26874089"">occurs starting at the 7min mark</a>). It is made by Charles B. Simone, M.MS, M.D., founder of the <a href=""http://www.drsimone.com/center.htm"">Simone Protective Cancer Center</a> (transcripted by me; may contain small errors):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From 1920 to the present time, we have made little or no progress in the treatment of adult cancers. So a person who gets prostate cancer or breast cancer today will live as long as a person who got it in 1920. No big change. With all the radiation therapy that began in the 10's and 20's, combination chemotherapy in the 60's, immunotherapy that began in the 70's, PET scans, MRI scans, you name it, billions and billions and billions of research dollar that we've thrown into this whole area of cancer research and treatment... little or no significant progress in the treatment of adult cancers.</p>

25,C# Converting set flags in a variable of type flag enumeration to an array of integers,"<p>I came up with this piece of code that converts the set flags in a variable of type Flag Enumeration and returns the set flags as integers.
I'd like to know if this is the best approach.</p>

<p>Example enumeration:
<pre><code>[Flags]
enum Status {
  None = 0x0,
  Active = 0x1,
  Inactive = 0x2,
  Canceled = 0x4,
  Suspended = 0x8
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>The extension method that converts the set flags to array of int that I came up with:</p>

<pre><code>public static class Extensions
{
    public static int[] ToIntArray(this System.Enum o) 
    {
        return o.ToString()
            .Split(new string[] { "", "" }, StringSplitOptions.None)
            .Select(i => (int)Enum.Parse(o.GetType(), i))
            .ToArray();
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>This is how I use it:</p>

<pre><code>Status filterStatus = Status.Suspended | Status.Canceled;

int[] filterFlags = filterStatus.toIntArray();

foreach (int flag in filterFlags) {
   Console.WriteLine(""{0}\n"", flag);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It will output:</p>

<pre><code>4
8</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, to get this done I'm doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Converting the variable to string. It outputs something like: Suspended, Canceled</li>
<li>Splitting that string into an array of strings: { ""Suspended"", ""Canceled"" }</li>
<li>Converting that string to the enumeration value with Enum.Parse.</li>
<li>Casting the value to an integer.</li>
<li>Converting the IEnumerable to int[].</li>
</ol>

<p>It works, but I just don't think it's the best approach. Any suggestions to improve this bit of code?</p>

27,Is my understanding of MAKE correct?,"<p>Taking the GNU make application as an example, when I create a makefile it is likened to a Visual Studio project file in that it contains the list of files and other items needed to compile an application. The makefile contains the path to the compiler as well as the path to all the files that could possibly be used in the compiling operation. The MAKE application reads the makefile and combines the sources into 1 file which the compiler then reads and converts into the relevant assembly/machine code.</p>

<p>The #include directive is a directive that tells the make file to:
""include the contents of this file into this point of the larger file that you're making to feed to the compiler then resume with the current file"".</p>

<p>The MAKE application also tells the compiler where to ""emit"" the result of the compile operation once the compiling is completed. In this regard a Visual Studio .csproj file is technically a XML based makefile for a Microsoft specific MAKE application.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9780099/asp-net-mvc-4-minification-background-images"">ASP.NET MVC 4 Minification &amp; Background Images</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except that I want to stick with MVC's own bundling if I can. I'm having a brain crash trying to figure out what the correct pattern is for specifying style bundles such that standalone css and image sets such as jQuery UI work.</p>

<p>I have a typical MVC site structure with <code>/Content/css/</code> which contains my base CSS such as <code>styles.css</code>. Within that css folder I also have subfolders such as <code>/jquery-ui</code> which contains its CSS file plus an <code>/images</code> folder. Image paths in the jQuery UI CSS are relative to that folder and I don't want to mess with them.</p>

<p>As I understand it, when I specify a <code>StyleBundle</code> I need to specify a virtual path which does not also match a real content path, because (assuming I'm ignoring routes to Content) IIS would then try to resolve that path as a physical file. So I'm specifying:</p>

<pre><code>bundles.Add( 
    new StyleBundle(""~/Content/styles/jquery-ui"")
        .Include(""~/Content/css/jquery-ui/*.css""));
</code></pre>

<p>rendered using:</p>

<p><code>@Styles.Render(""~/Content/styles/jquery-ui"")</code></p>

<p>I can see the request going out to:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost/MySite/Content/styles/jquery-ui?v=nL_6HPFtzoqrts9nwrtjq0VQFYnhMjY5EopXsK8cxmg1</code></p>

<p>This is returning the correct minified CSS response. 
But then the browser sends a request for a relatively linked image as:</p>

<p><code>http://localhost/MySite/Content/styles/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_100_eeeeee_1x100.png</code></p>

<p>Which is a <code>404</code>.</p>

<p>I understand that the last part of my URL <code>jquery-ui</code> is an extensionless URL, a handler for my bundle, so I can see why the relative request for the image is simply <code>/styles/images/</code>. </p>

<p>So my question is <strong>what is the correct way</strong> of handling this situation? </p>

43,High load on X3220 Quad Core Linux Apache server,"<p>I'm seriously in need of help.  My sites are now nearly impossible to use because of massive loads on my server.  I'm already a month late on my mortgage and this really isn't helping my situation.  I've been working on fixing this intermittent load problem for months (never this bad). </p>

<p>I'm suspecting some kind of attack since I'm under DDOS attack a lot!  I've been trying to figure out what is causing the load but I'm afraid I just don't have the experience or knowledge to understand all the data I've been looking at.  I don't even know where to begin or how to test for the large array of attacks out there.</p>

<p>Here's some data you might find useful...</p>

<p>Server:  Xeon X3220 Quad Core 2.4 GHz - Linux, FreeBSD 500 GB HD and 8 Gig of Ram.  Runs Centos release 5.7

<p>Warning:  All sites are softcore adult sites - mostly fantasy art like elves and amazons.</p>

<p>1)  Sites may run fine for weeks or just days at less than 10 load then start jumping to 40-80 load - no idea why.  Same sites, same mods, same amount of traffic - just WHAM!</p>

<p>2) I get an email almost every day that says:  ""Large Number of Failed Login Attempts from IP (different each time)"".  My webhost (who almost never helps me) told me it was a udp flood or something.</p>

<p>3) I've changed the port for MySQL from the default.  If I ever put it back to the default - I get Loads of over 100 from what must be a constant mysql port flood.</p>

<p>4)  I've reconfigured MYSQL.  Link:  <a href=""http://www.deadlyamazons.com/logs/mycnf.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deadlyamazons.com/logs/mycnf.txt</a></p>

<p>5) I have 3 Joomla Jomsocial networks.  I've spent a couple weeks turning all the mods/plugins off, waiting a day and then turning them back on the next day or later if there isn't any change (there hasn't been).  For example, on Thursday I'll turn off videos, on Friday I'll turn off chat.. etc and nothing changes the load appreciably.   </p>

<p>6) Joomla info:  All SEF turned off - sh404sef completely disabled and removed.  Components: Joomla 1.5.22, Jomsocial 2.0.5, Kunena 1/31/2011, HWDMediashare 11/22/2010  and JBolo Chat 2.7.3, Comet Chat or Envolve Chat.   Page Compression is on, Cache is on 15 mins.  </p>

<p>Hi guys
I'm back with some more info about my poor server.  The server is currently limping along with a load of between 20 and 60 averaging about 30.</p>

<p>I'll add an incentive to solving my problem: $100 via Paypal for an answer that solves the 'load' problem without the suggestion of buying 1 or more extra servers.  Again, these sites worked fine with even higher traffic on a lower powered server.</p>

<p>I just recompiled apache 2.22 adding eaccelerator and zend-optimizer - no change.  The other mod I included was QOS which keeps the # of connections at a lower level.  I've had QOS working for awhile.</p>

<p>Yes I did turn off the port to MySQL I should've mentioned that.</p>

44,Jquery add title attribute with data from JSON call,"<p>I'm trying to dynamically add titles to a number of images using values obtained from a JSON call.</p>

<p>This is what I have so far </p>

    url: 'http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos/T2aMBeeM4yw?v=2&amp;alt=jsonc',

    }   
    });

   alert(song_title); //this to be removed
   //the title attr below is only added when the above alert is in place    
   $(this).attr('title', song_title);
   $(this).attr('alt', ""This works everytime""); 
   });
</code></pre>

<p>
</p>

<p>Now the above works but only when I ""stop"" the process by adding in the unwanted alert - I can only guess that the code is executing before it has retrieved the data from the JSON call (?) and the alert enables it to catch up.</p>

<p>I imagine I need another function that executes after the JSON call or for the code to go into the 'success' function but I'm not sure how to keep hold of the 'this' element if that is the case.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to make a status bar notification to the user (i.e. Notification / NotificationManager) from the kernel? </p>

<p>A similar functionality I'm trying to achieve is like connecting to the phone via USB. When the phone detects a USB connection, a status bar notification is produced (and if debugging is enabled, it will tell you that too). How is this done? At some point the kernel sends a signal, but how is the notification generated?</p>

<p>The approach I'm going to try and implement is using the NDK. Create a library that listens/waits for a signal from my LKM, then use then create an app that's just a background service that notifies when the signal is received. </p>

<p>Is there a more elegant solution for this? And I'd like to not have to recompile the AOSP. </p>

50,How to control error keys using ModelStateWrapper=,"<p>I’m using the a service layer with a ModelStateWrapper as shown <a href=""http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/validating-with-a-service-layer-cs"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>What’s he proper way to control the error keys to use when validating in the service layer so they correspond to the input names in my views?</p>

<p>e.g. I have the following ViewModel for a customer:</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomerViewModel
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    /*…*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the following ViewModel for some use case’s View (the user can create two customers on the fly in this use case by entering their names):</p>

<pre><code>public class SomeOtherUseCaseViewModel
{
    public CustomerViewModel BuyingCustomer { get; set; }
    public CustomerViewModel SellingCustomer { get; set; }
    /*… */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which I use in the View like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- … --&gt;
&lt;%: Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.BuyingCustomer.Name) %&gt;
&lt;%: Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.BuyingCustomer.Name) %&gt;
&lt;!-- … --&gt;
&lt;%: Html.EditorFor(model =&gt; model.SellingCustomer.Name) %&gt;
&lt;%: Html.ValidationMessageFor(model =&gt; model.SellingCustomer.Name) %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In my customer service I’ve the following validation method which gets called when creating the customer (note that this is a different Customer class, this is a domain class):</p>

<pre><code>public bool ValidateCustomer(Customer customer)
{
    /* Check if there is another customer with the same name */
    if (/*…*/)
    {
        _validationDictionary.addError(“Name”, “There is another customer with the same name”); //the _validationDictionary holds the ModelStateWrapper
        return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Do you see my problem?</p>

<p>Depending on the View, the error should be added with the key <code>“BuyingCustomer.Name”</code> or <code>“SellingCustomer.Name”</code> (or eventually there will be two errors, one with each key) instead of just “Name”; otherwise the framework won’t properly highlight the fields and show the errors.</p>

<p><strong>What is the proper way to solve this situation neatly?</strong> I don't want to pass the ""error key prefix"" to the service layer, because that's a UI concern and not a service layer concern, (right?).</p>

58,SSRS limit length of text but keep full words,"<p>In my table I have essentially 2 columns (many more but there is an obvious left side and right side). One of the fields, FIELD1, on the left side comes from a LookupSet() and each ID can have two items from FIELD1. Using a join(lookupset(), vbcrlf) I am able to get both values for the ID and put it into one cell in the table. This works but with the vbcrlf, the row height is increased. This causes a problem because there is data on the right side which cannot have additional space between it.</p>

<p>I did a split(join(lookupset())).getValue(0) for the first row and then the row below it for value 1. With some iif statements to check errors etc, this works.</p>

<p>One problem I solved is that the values for FIELD1 can be longer than the width of the cell, but will not take up more than two. I was able to do some substring magic in oracle like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ID, SUBSTR(FIELD1, 1, 70) FROM....
UNION
SELECT ID, SUBSTR(FIELD1, 70) FROM ...
</code></pre>

<p>using sorting, I am able to get up to 4 rows of data per ID which I will be able to split the lookupset and get each value into the table.</p>

<p>My last problem, and hopefully someone can help with is that when I ge the substring, It can cut off words and the next row will start with the rest of the word.
Is there a way, possibly using a regex to make sure to keep words in tact, but also to ensure that the total length returned is &lt; some number of characters? I am happy to abandon any part of the approach i am currently taking if I am off track.</p>

<p>I'd like some suggestions on how to do this.</p>

<p>But what I was thinking was that every 3 days the third day backups are deleted. But one is kept. </p>

<p>This would mean that my backup total is 73.5gb after 3 days of backups. Then I want to keep that third day backup for 1 week. So on the 10th day it is deleted. So about 85gb of total data is backed up.</p>

<p>Ever hour for 2 days and then 1 hour from every day after that 8 times.</p>

<p>I was thinking the easiest way to do it would be move that 1 hour backup from the third day to a new folder and have a separate script for it that is run daily. However I am not sure how I would go about picking out one of them out from the others and how to delete the ones older than 2 days. </p>

<p>Certain events are tracked and timed at several data sources S1 ... SN. The recorded information is the event type and timestamp. There may be several events of the same type sequentially or they may be intermittent.

There is typically a time difference between observations of the same event at different sources. This time difference has a constant component due to physical location of the sources but may also have a varying component introduced by network latency and other factors.</p>

84,Ruby Savon compared to Java Axis,"<p>I'm trying to use the Yodlee soap APIs. They give examples with Apache Axis
Any perspectives on using Ruby and Savon versus Java and Axis? </p>

<p>With Ruby/Savon, it seems that the best thing to do is to skip using the WSDL files and generate the requests based on examples from the Java/Axis program. I tried using the WSDL feature of Savon, but I could not get it to work with the many embedded types and namespaces in the very complex WSDLs.</p>

<p>Looking at the Java/Axis code, there's a huge amount of generated code that isolates the Java developer from knowing about the XML. Has anybody ever tried to replicate Axis in the Ruby world?</p>

<p>Thanks. </p>

86,Enumerate All Installed Applications on OS X,"<h1>Basic problem</h1>

<p>I'm looking for a solution to enumerate all applications installed on a (Mac) OS X system, i.e. all application bundles registered with <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Carbon/Reference/LaunchServicesReference/Reference/reference.html"" rel=""nofollow"">LaunchServices</a>.</p>

<h1>Simple approach that did not work</h1>

<p>(Please note: <code>lsregister</code> can be found under <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support/lsregister</code>).</p>

<p>Currently I am using the output of <code>lsregister -dump | grep -E '^.*[ \\t]*path:[ \\t]+(\/.*)$' | grep -Eo '\/.*'</code>, which has a few problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.app</code> bundles with newlines (<code>\n</code>, which is valid on UNIX) are not handled correctly (This issue would be fixable by writing a proper parser)</li>
<li><p><code>lsregister</code> doesn't handle correctly weird filename (e.g. containing the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-to-left_mark"" rel=""nofollow"">RTL mark</a>). <code>lsregister</code> just seems to ignore files with the RTL mark in their name. 
If you want to, you can create a file with RTL in its name by running the following command.</p>

<pre><code>python -c 'import shutil; shutil.copytree(u""/Applications/TextEdit.app"", u""/Applications/ThisIsAWeird\u202EApp.app"")'
</code></pre>

<p>After doing this, <code>lsregister -dump | grep ThisIsAWeird</code> will <em>not</em> reveal it. But when you right click on a text file and go to ""Open With"" you'll that LaunchServices and Finder still support that file.
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/c40Jq.png"" alt=""see yourself""></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Simply enumerating all files in <code>/Applications</code> and other directories does not work because LaunchServices is aware of application bundles in arbitrary folders and I also need these apps.</p>

<h1>Other approch that I didn't get to work</h1>

<p>Apparently, there's a private API function called <code>_LSFindApplications</code> which does exactly what I need to do but I can't get it to work and didn't find any inofficial documentation on the internet. (proof it exists: <code>nm /System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/LaunchServices  | grep __LSFindApplications$</code>)</p>

<p>The point of this is to make sure I don't have any windsor configuration issues that I won't realize until I access an action on that controller.  The problem is that all my object registrations are registered as <code>PerWebRequestLifestyle</code> so I don't get issues with my Entity Framwork Data Context being shared across web requests (which causes errors when multiple actions are run).</p>

<p>However, whenever I run this unit test I get the following exception:</p>

<p>One possible reason for the segmentation violations that was suggested is that the C library functions ""malloc"" and ""free"" may not be thread-safe. Is this really a possibility? And is there any way that I can make sure? </p>

<p>I compiled the MEX file using the ""GNU C 2.14.90 development"" C Library - so I guess I'm looking for a website where this is distributed / these types of questions are answered. </p>

<p>I did a lot of thesting and found out that the access to the BlockingCollection bcPort seems to be the problem. bcPort gets constantly chunks from another data-adder thread which is also supposed not to influnce the ui thread. So I dont understand the following:</p>

<p>1.) Why is the GUI getting stuck when I am using different threads for adding and 
packaging the chunks?</p>

<p>2.) Why is this happening when I am using a BC for storing data? Arent these thread safe collections for this certain purpose?</p>

<p>By the way: Windows 7 ResourceManager shows 100% CPU usage during streaming, the chunks contain about 2000 float values each, 4 or 5 of them a rushing in per second. I also disabled the Logger but no effect. The consumer and evaluation threads are disabled. </p>

<p>Besides the ui thread, there is only a thread called ""ReceiveAndSave"" which makes chunks out of incoming float vals (see code, Method ""Add""). the thread ""Producer"" is doing some further packaging and enqeues the chunks for the consumer (deactivated). </p>

<pre><code>   public void Add(short iChannel, float fValue)

108,"Tough routing problem with Linux, Quagga and OpenVPN","<h2>The Setup</h2>

<p>I have an OpenVPN server that acts as a central router. It is configured with ""topology subnet"" command. Clients are Debian Linux nodes and each have one (or more) subnets directly connected to them.</p>

<p>The objective is for any client connected to the VPN to be able to access the subnets connected behind each other client.</p>

<p>In order to spread the routing information, we have installed Quagga on the clients and on the server. This works fine using the OSPF daemon. Routing is enabled on all the clients and the server as well.</p>

<h2>Routing table</h2>

<p>The routing table on the server is the following :</p>

<pre><code>Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
10.2.10.1       10.8.0.4        255.255.255.255 UGH   20     0        0 tun0
192.168.100.0   10.8.0.4        255.255.255.0   UG    20     0        0 tun0
192.168.1.0     10.8.0.4        255.255.255.0   UG    20     0        0 tun0
</code></pre>

<p>The subnet I want to access is 192.168.100.0/24. The gateway in question responds perfectly fine and I can connect to it alright.</p>

<p>I don't think this will be of any use but here is part of the client routing table :</p>

<pre><code>10.2.10.1       0.0.0.0         255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 tun0
192.168.100.0   0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth1
192.168.1.0     0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
</code></pre>

<h2>Where things start going south</h2>

<p>Pinging from the server (10.8.0.1) to any hosts (including the VPN client interface) in the 192.168.100.0/24 subnet fails. If I tcpdump the tun interface on the VPN client, I see no relevant package. If I tcpdump the tun interface on the VPN server, I see the package in question being sent out.</p>

<p>The real edgy thing is that when I traceroute to a valid IP in the 192.168.100.0 subnet, it doesn't discover any hops (there should be just one). If I traceroute directly to the next hop (10.8.0.4), it responds fine.</p>

<p>I really hope I am being clear as this is quite a complex problem. I'll be happy to provide extra information at your request.</p>

<li><p>All database manipulation is done via <strong>stored procedures only</strong>. No table is directly accessed by the application.</p></li>

<p>Based on these facts (dbo schema with my objects, AD domain group security login, stored procedure execution only) I wonder which role membership should be set on AD domain group server login to use my database.</p>

I'm trying to figure out a good solution that won't take several months to develop but will still provide good flexibility for future enhancements.</p>

<p>My options I believe are:</p>

<pre><code>cms+e-commerce plugin (e.g. drupal+ubercart)
e-commerce platform that is extendable (e.g. magento)
framework+e-commerce platform (e.g. ci+magento)

<p>The site will be similar to etsy where users can have items that they sell with their own portfolio page. The client wants to add many custom features as well. Also, the site will serve up a lot of images and audio.</p>

<p>I'm concerned that using strictly a e-commerce platform will give me a lot of obstacles to overcome rather than use just a cart+framework. I know Magento is written on Zend, but while I have used Magento, I'm not very familiar with Zend and it seems to take quite a while to learn.</p>

<p>I have never used ubercart,wp e-commerce, or virtuemart, so I'm not sure of the limitations. The products will not need to be configurable. But we will need to store financial information. I'm thinking braintree's vault or authorize.net cim.</p>

<p>I'd like to do the framework+ecommerce platform route. But the client would also like a lower price option, I'm leaning towards drupal+ubercart.</p>

123,O(1) algorithm to determine if node is descendant of another node in a multiway tree?,"<p>Imagine the following tree:</p>

<pre><code>    A
   / \
  B   C
 / \   \
D   E   F
</code></pre>

<p>I'm looking for a way to query if for example F is a descendant of A (note: F doesn't need to be a <strong>direct</strong> descendant of F), which, in this particular case would be true. Only a limited amount of potential parent nodes need to be tested against a larger potential descendants node pool.</p>

<p>UPDATE: when testing whether a node is a descendant of a node in the potential parent pool, it needs to be tested against ALL potential parent nodes.</p>

<p>This is what a came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Convert multiway tree to a trie, i.e. assign the following prefixes to every node in the above tree:</p>

<pre><code> A = 1
 B = 11
 C = 12
 D = 111
 E = 112
 F = 121
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then, reserve a bit array for every possible prefix size and add the parent nodes to be tested against, i.e. if C is added to the potential parent node pool, do:</p>

<pre><code>  1    2    3  &lt;- Prefix length

*[1]  [1]  ...
 [2] *[2]  ...
 [3]  [3]  ...
 [4]  [4]  ...
 ...  ...
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>When testing if a node is a descendant of a potential parent node, take its trie prefix, lookup the first character in the first ""prefix array"" (see above) and if it is present, lookup the second prefix character in the second ""prefix array"" and so on, i.e. testing F leads to:</p>

<pre><code> F = 1    2    1

   *[1]  [1]  ...
    [2] *[2]  ...
    [3]  [3]  ...
    [4]  [4]  ...
    ...  ...
</code></pre>

<p>so yes F, is a descendant of C.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This test seems to be worst case O(n), where n = maximum prefix length = maximum tree depth, so its worst case is exactly equal to the obvious way of just going up the tree and comparing nodes. However, this performs much better if the tested node is near the bottom of the tree and the potential parent node is somewhere at the top. Combining both algorithms would mitigate both worst case scenarios. However, memory overhead is a concern.</p>

<p>Is there another way for doing that? Any pointers greatly appreciated!</p>

125,C++ & DirectX - setting shader,"<p>Does someone know a fast way to invoke shader processing via DirectX?</p>

<p>Right now I'm setting shaders using <code>D3DXCreateEffectFromFile</code> calls, which create shaders in runtime <em>(once per each shader)</em> from <code>*.fx</code> files.</p>

<p><em>Rendering part for every object (<strong>every patch in my case - see further</strong>) then means something like:</em></p>

<pre><code>// --------------------
// Preprocessing
effect-&gt;Begin();
effect-&gt;BeginPass(0);
effect-&gt;SetMatrix (or Vector or whatever - internal shader parameters) (...)
effect-&gt;CommitChanges();

// --------------------
// Geometry rendering

// Pass the geometry to render
// ...

// --------------------
// Postprocessing

// End 'effect' passes
effect-&gt;EndPass();
effect-&gt;End();
</code></pre>

<p>This is okay, but the profiler shows weird things - <strong><code>preprocessing</code></strong> <em>(see code)</em> takes about 60% of time <em>(I'm rendering terrain object of 256 patches where every patch contains about 10k vertices)</em>.</p>

<p>Actual geometry rendering takes ~35% and postprocessing - 5% of total rendering time.</p>

<p>This seems pretty strange to me and I guess that <code>D3DXEffect</code> interface may not be the best solution for this sort of things. </p>

<p><strong>I've got 2 questions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Do I need to implement my own shader controller / wrapper (probably, low-level) and where should I start from?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Would compiling shaders help to somehow improve parameter setting performance?</strong></p>

<p>Maybe somebody knows how to solve this kind of problem / some implemented shader interface or could give some advices about how is this kind of problem solved in modern game engines.</p>

132,Pipelining within Process Groups,"<p>I'm currently reading Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment by Stevens/Rago.</p>

<p>Within the process group section of the book, the author discusses how process groups are utilized commonly by shells for pipelining.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, the argument shown below could have been generated by
  shell commands of the form:</p>
  
  <p>proc1 | proc2 &amp; proc3 | proc4 | proc5</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots of other resources also discuss the relationship between process groups and pipelining. However, the one thing which I cannot find is an explanation of how the pipelining portion of this is implemented.</p>

<p>I know that in Linux shells like Boune-again shell (BASH), processes in a pipeline are executed in parallel -- that is, in the previous example showing <code>proc3 | proc4 | proc5</code>, all three of these processes are simultaneously executed. The stdin of proc4 is connected to the stdin of proc3. (I also know that MS-DOS used temporary files and did not execute pipes in parallel, but let's ignore that for the moment).</p>

<p>So, I've got proc3, proc4, proc5 all in a process group. Fantastic. How does this actually help with creating the pipelines between them?</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, I need to do the following to enable pipelining in a shell which I build:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create N-1 pipelines, where N is the number of processes in the
pipelined statement fork() the shell process N times</li>
<li>In each forked process, I need to use dup2 to properly set up the
shared pipelines</li>
<li>Then, after all of the forked processes have confirmation that they
have all finalized setting up their pipes (likely via some IPC via a
shared memory space), each can then run exec() and actually launch
their respective processes.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, all of the texts which I keep reading act as if process groups provide some magical functionality to create these pipelines -- or they are simply neglecting to mention the procedure I outlined above.</p>

<p>Any comments or advice is always appreciated.</p>

139,JSP form drop down from database.,"<p>so ive got several tables which shows the values in my databases. I can add, edit, and delete them. Now several of these tables have FK relations to each other so to add in some tables must be correctly aligned with values already existing in other tables. Say I have 3 tables (A/B/C) and i want to add something in B which must relate to A and C. I need the form to populate drop downs from both of the tables with existing values so that the user may select them and create an entry. So far i havent had much luck in this.</p>

<p>I have a DAO which querys the server and generates a list of the values in table C. I then have a controller which right now handles displaying the values in B when you go to edit it:</p>

<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value = ""/cmsattribute_add"", method = RequestMethod.GET)
public String Home(ModelMap model, HttpServletRequest request) {
CmsAttributeModel cmsAttribute = new CmsAttributeModel();
CmsGroupModel cmsGroupList = new CmsGroupModel();
model.addAttribute(""cmsAttribute"", cmsAttribute);
return ""/cmsattribute_submit"";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the form for table B AKA CmsAttribute which has several other fields but this is one of the ones that needs to be populated from the existing values in the other database called CmsGroup, specifically the IDs of the entries:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form:form name =""cmsform"" commandName=""cmsAttribute"" action='${linkto}' &gt; 
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;&lt;span class=""required""&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; CMS Group ID:&lt;/TD&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;form:errors path=""cmsGroupId"" cssClass=""required"" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Right now im just stuck on how to tie them all together. Right now the form page shows a dropdown for the CmsGroup ID values but there is nothing in it. Im quite sure im just missing a method or a call to simply tie everything in.....Thanks</p>

So I'd like to post my original problem:</p>

<p>I'm trying to find a continuous bounded function $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$
such that </p>

<p>$$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi t}}e^{-(y-x)^2/2t}f(y)dy -f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{-y^2/2}(f(x+\sqrt{t}y)-f(x))dy$$</p>

<p>does NOT uniformly converge to $0$ for $t\to 0+$. I'm not completely sure that there is actually one. But I'm fairly certain.

<pre><code> AjaxOptions ajaxOpts = new AjaxOptions {
UpdateTargetId = ""tabledata"",
Url = Url.Action(""AppointmentData"")
};
</code></pre>

<p>And than just passing this ""ajaxOpts"" into the Ajax.BeginForm() I am unable to store the ajax options in a variable and than pass that into Ajax.ActionLink. Please see the syntax I am attempting below:</p>

AjaxOptions ajaxOpts = new AjaxOptions
{
    UpdateTargetId = ""catlist-"" + Model.Count,

})

<p>Whilst something like the below without trying to use graceful degradation works fine of course, but with jscript turned off it just emits the partialview without the rest of the page:</p>

new AjaxOptions
{

})

<p>It's understandable that when you don't specify the URL for the form and instead just use AjaxOptions as a parameter and jscript is turned off the form will just by default post back to the Action that rendered the page. But is something similar possible for the ActionLink ?  </p>

<p>I am working on an application to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses between a web browser and a web server (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3180499/how-to-intercept-and-modify-http-responses-on-server-side"">how to intercept and modify HTTP responses on server side?</a> for the background). I decided to implement a reverse proxy in ASP.Net which forwards client requests to the back-end HTTP server, translates links and headers from the response to the properly ""proxified"" URL, and sends the response to the client after having extracted relevant information from the response. </p>

<p>It is working as expected, except for the authentication part: the web server uses NTLM authentication by default, and just forwarding requests and responses through the reverse proxy does not allow the user to be authenticated on the remote application. Both the reverse proxy and the web application are on the same physical machine and are executed in the same IIS server (Windows server 2008/IIS 7 if that matters). I tried both enabling and disabling authentication on the reverse proxy app with no luck. </p>

<p>I have looked for information about it, and it seems to be related to the ""double-hop problem"", which I do not understand. My question is: is there a way to authenticate the user on the remote application through the reverse proxy using NTLM? If there is none, are there alternative authentication methods I could use? </p>

<p>With an analogy that, I am guessing it says $f(k)$ returns a value as great as $k^2/2$, and has another term that is at least of degree 2. But then it wouldn't be giving much info on $f(k)$, it could be of any order. </p>

<p>And to fix this problem, i am suggested the following</p>

<pre><code>Remove ""@Override"" annotation

<p>Tough removing the @Override fixes the issue but why does it complain about it and also removing it may cause stopping some functionality of its parent etc?? </p>

<p>I am observing a core data property from within a NSManagedObject sub-class and the method that gets called when the property changes calls another method but in this method it adds Core Data objects which triggers the KVO method which triggers the method again and so forth. Or so it seems, I'm not too sure about that because something different seems to happen, here is the series of events …</p>

<ol>
<li>I click a button syncing with iCal (this in an IBAction with the exact same code thats in the method syncKVO). This sync works fine.</li>
<li>I add an object to my outline view. All is well.</li>
<li>I change its name which triggers the KVO Declaration (because I changed the 'name' property) which syncs with iCal. Works fine. </li>
<li>I delete the object I just added and somehow it triggers the KVO declaration (thus triggering the method) and puts me into an <strong>infinite loop</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Detaching and reattaching observers with </p>

<pre><code>[JGManagedObject removeObserver];
//and
[JGManagedObject addObserver];
</code></pre>

<p>but with that it works the first time but stops the method the second time saying that it cannot remove the observer because it is not observing, which doesn't make sense because I added the observer again the first time. That is why I left this code out of the actual method else it would stop on the second sync.</p>

<p>The problem appears on the line which is bold. The UNIX <em>patch</em> application does not recognize file names because these lines should contain only the file name without any additional info.
If I remove text after file name on those lines, <em>patch</em> will run successfully.
So my question is: is it possible to generate diff file from tf diff without such information in the header so that it is compatible with <em>patch</em>? </p>

<p>There is an alternative like applying regex and replacing such lines but it would be the last attempt to make it working.

<pre><code>(from match in
from s in SystemErrors
select Regex.Match(s.Description, ""..."")
select new 
{
  FamilyCode = match.Groups[""FamilyCode""].Value,
  ProductPrefix = match.Groups[""ProductPrefix""].Value,
  BillingGroup = match.Groups[""BillingGroup""].Value,
  Debtor = match.Groups[""Debtor""].Value
}).Distinct()

<p>As you can see I'm trying to extract data from a text description in a log table using groups. The query works, but the Distinct doesn't want to work, it returns a line for all Match.</p>

<p>I have read that distinct should work with anonymous type, matching each property. Even more strange is that distinct does actually do something, it orders the values alphabetically by the FamilyCode (and then by ProductPrefix, etc.).</p>

<p>Has someone an idea on why this isn't working?
Thanks</p>

219,How to put text over an image without absolute positioning or setting the image as backbround,"<p>I'm trying to see if it is possible to put some text over an image without using position: absolute or having the image being, the background of an element.<br>
The reason for the constraints is that the HTML code is going into an e-mail, and it turns out that hotmail supports neither.<br>
I remember that when I first began studying CSS, fiddling around with float-ing text around images I often ended up with the text merrily going all over the image. Sadly, I can't reproduce that behavior.</p>

<p>Full story (edited in):<br>
I received a fancy layout from the graphics designer. It's basically a nice background picture, with logos linking to websites and what basically is a ""text goes here"" area in the middle.<br>
As usual in these cases, I'm using tables to make sure that everything stays in place AND works crossbrowser+crossmailclient.<br>
The problem arises from the fact that the middle ""text goes here"" area is not a white rectangle, but has a some background graphics.<br>
Having made some test, it appears that Live Hotmail does not seem to like neither position: absolute or background-image; relative margins are also not good because they'd ruin the rest of the layout.</p>

<p>Current version, works in any other mail client/website:</p>

<pre><code>...
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;img src='myimage.jpg' width='600' height='400' alt=''&gt;
&lt;p style=""position: absolute; top: 120px; width: 500px; padding-left: 30px;""&gt;
blablabla&lt;br&gt;
yadda yadda&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  <p>To update your installation from a previous version, all you need to do is to replace everything in the directory texmf/tex/generic/pgf with the files of the new version (or in all the directories where pgf was installed, if you chose a tds-compliant installation).</p>

237,DataSet defined by ReadXmlSchema: why do column datatypes change after filling?,"<p>I have a process that exports the results of a database call to a CSV file. The data types and file format must match a specific format so the file can be uploaded to an external system. This process has been running for maybe 7 or 8 years on an ASP.NET (.NET 2.0) webform and suddenly (sometime over the last 6-18 months) it's not working the way it used to. Perhaps after .NET 4.0 was installed on the client server, or maybe after some other framework update(?) or windows update(?) or provider update(?). Our DLL has not changed in a few years. I'd like to fix this legacy process with the least amount of hacking and slashing possible.</p>

<p>There are three data types being exported: integer, string, and decimal. <b>The problem is that all the integer columns are being exported as decimals now.</b> The CSV export library looks at the datatypes of the columns to determine the correct output format, so I use a XSD file to define my DataSet before filling it. Here is a simplified example of the XSD file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" standalone=""yes""?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema id=""FDSR"" xmlns="""" xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"" xmlns:msdata=""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-msdata""&gt;

      &lt;/xs:choice&gt;
    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
  &lt;/xs:element&gt;
&lt;/xs:schema&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The data types defined for each column used to persist after the data was loaded, but now they are reset by the data load. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Dim ds as New DataSet
ds.ReadXmlSchema(""MyFile.xsd"")

' Breakpoint here: 
' ds.Tables(0).Columns(0).DataType shows: {Name = ""Int64"" FullName = ""System.Int64""}

Dim db as New DatabaseCall(""my db call..."")    
ds = db.ReturnData()

' Breakpoint here: 
' ds.Tables(0).Columns(0).DataType now shows: {Name = ""Decimal"" FullName = ""System.Decimal""}

GenerateCSVOutput(ds)
</code></pre>

<p><b>How can I force the <code>integer</code> column to remain an <code>integer</code> after the database call? Or how can I change the datatype after populating the dataset?</b></p>

<p>This code has been simplified for posting, but basically the db.ReturnData() is calling an Oracle stored procedure to do some processing and return the data using <code>System.Data.OracleClient.OracleDataAdapter.Fill(dataset)</code> to populate the DataSet. There is no <code>integer</code> column in Oracle so the source table has the column defined as <code>NUMBER(1,0)</code>. It's definitely outputting the correct precision, I just don't understand why the column type in the DataSet is suddenly changing when it is explicitly defined as an integer. Unfortunately the CSV file needs to be uploaded to an external government system that will not accept <code>1.0</code> for <code>1</code>...</p>

<pre><code>Grit::Tag.create_tag_object(repo, params, actor)

<p>But that will only create a lightweight tag. To have a referenced tag I need to create a ref to the tag also, but the implementation of update_ref looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>def update_ref(head, commit_sha)

  self.git.fs_write(""refs/heads/#{head}"", commit_sha)
  commit_sha

245,How to use GL_HALF_FLOAT_OES typed textures in iOS?,"<p>I'm trying to create a float texture to store intermediate results of my rendering pipeline created by a fragment shader. I need the values of the fragments to be <em>signed floats</em>.</p>

<p>I understand that there is the <a href=""http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/OES/OES_texture_float.txt"">OES_texture_float</a> extension which should be supported by all new iOS devices (i.e. beginning from iPhone 3GS/iPod Touch 3/iPad according to the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/OpenGLESPlatforms/OpenGLESPlatforms.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008793-CH106-SW1"">Apple guide</a>).</p>

<p>However, when I create such a texture using</p>

<pre><code>glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, width, height, 0, GL_RGB, GL_HALF_FLOAT_OES, NULL);

<p>start my app and inspect it in Instruments, it tells me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, width, height, 0, GL_RGB, GL_HALF_FLOAT_OES, NULL) : (invalid enum=0x8d61): Invalid enum for argument 'type'</p>

<p>The curious thing is that it's nevertheless working on my iPhone 4S, but not on a iPhone 4 (which should be supported as well). The error message appears for both devices, though. But on the iPhone 4 OpenGL can't build a valid framebuffer object using this texture as a rendering target. On the 4S that works perfectly well.</p>

252,Custom View Scrolling issues Android,"<p>I've been designing an application that requires the use of a scrollbar on a custom view. The problem that I have run into is that my custom view's height will constantly change when new items are added by the user. I suspect that this isn't a very unusual problem, but to complicate things, I'm not actually adding new objects to my custom view, I'm just drawing Bitmap images on the canvas. The reason this is troublesome to me is when Android inflates the layout, it sets the size to be whatever I tell it (0dip) and as I add the Bitmaps, it simply changes the size to fill the Scrollview; thereby, whenever the Custom View draws an image beyond the current height constraints, instead of scrolling, the app simply cuts the picture off to maintain the current height.</p>

<p>(This is for a card game app, so I wanted to fan out your current deck in a easy to view and edit fashion.)</p>

<p>Here is the relevant code :</p>

<pre><code>public class DeckEdit extends Activity implements FilterQueryProvider  {

    filterText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.card_search_box);

258,mvc .net and jquery how do you remove a character before posting to avoid validation?,"<p>I have a property on a model that accepts a string value and stores hex values for colors</p>

<p><strong>eg: EEEEEE, 000000</strong></p>

<p>I integrated a jquery plugin so that the user can use a color picker. I like it since it's very easy to use. The problem is that when you pick a color it fills up the text box with a ""#"" character which then makes it easy to change the color of the textbox (for User friendliness purposes - it's part of the plugin). </p>

<p>Now I want to save the value on post but the problem is the validation on the model will only accept the following characters ""0-9A-F"". Which I also want to maintain (no special characters on the database).</p>

<p>So I figured to avoid the validation I would modify the textbox on click of the button. My questions are:</p>

<p><strong>1. Is that the most efficient way?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. If it is, how would i do it using jquery? or something else?</strong></p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts.</p>

275,VPN Network intermittantly fails to provide internet: What could be possible causes,"<p>We have a small office with our own VPN setup. We occasionally experience failures in our internet connection where we cannot access the internet. Most of the time the internet connection will resume by itself(without me doing anything) after a period of time(10 mins). </p>

<p><strong>Would you be able to suggest possible causes of the connection failure so I can then go and run some tests?</strong></p>

<p>Our network architecture is like so:  </p>

<ul>
<li>A 'Billion' brand router that is connected to the internet via phone
cable and then connected to our Cisco Switch   </li>
<li>A Cisco Switch/Bus which is connected to all our office nodes, our
external harddrive and also to our router as stated above. All connections are via ethernet cable   </li>
<li>A series of work computers(nodes) connected via ethernet cable to the Cisco
switch.  </li>
<li>Our ISP is TPG Australia  </li>
<li>We have a Virtual Private Network  </li>
<li>All the ethernet cables are about 3 years old</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you think that the causes of our intermittant connection problems could be due to the following:                  </p>

<ul>
<li>Data collisions in the ethernet cables  </li>
<li>Old/Faulty ethernet cables  </li>
<li>Our ISP has bad service  </li>
<li>Can you think of any other causes of the problem?  </li>

The thing is, I don't want to specify an external port (because one, the external port doesn't matter for the application to be found, and two, I want to make sure multiple people on the same router can use the application, and sharing a port is not an option, obviously).  None of the API's I'm looking at says anything about begin able to not specifying a port, but would sending something like <code>0</code> or <code>-1</code> cause it to choose a port itself, or do I have to choose a random number and hope for the best?</p>

<p>Also, will the port mappings ever expire, or do I have to forcefully de-map all of them?  I was wondering for in-case the application crashes or the computer looses power or something.  </p>

297,How can I pass a property as a delegate?,"<p>This is a theoretical question, I've already got a solution to my problem that took me down a different path, but I think the question is still potentially interesting.</p>

<p>Can I pass object properties as delegates in the same way I can with methods?  For instance:</p>

<p>Let's say I've got a data reader loaded up with data, and each field's value needs to be passed into properties of differing types having been checked for DBNull.  If attempting to get a single field, I might write something like:</p>

<pre><code>if(!rdr[""field1""].Equals(DBNull.Value)) myClass.Property1 = rdr[""field1""];
</code></pre>

<p>But if I've got say 100 fields, that becomes unwieldy very quickly.  There's a couple of ways that a call to do this might look nice:</p>

<pre><code>myClass.Property = GetDefaultOrValue&lt;string&gt;(rdr[""field1""]); //Which incidentally is the route I took
</code></pre>

<p>Which might also look nice as an extension method:</p>

<pre><code>myClass.Property = rdr[""field1""].GetDefaultOrValue&lt;string&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>SetPropertyFromDbValue&lt;string&gt;(myClass.Property1, rdr[""field1""]); //Which is the one that I'm interested in on this theoretical level
</code></pre>

<p>In the second instance, the property would need to be passed as a delegate in order to set it.</p>

<p>So the question is in two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this possible?</li>
<li>What would that look like?</li>
</ol>

303,javascript callback after loop,"<p>Iv'e just started a new Wordpress blog and i have started to build the JavaScript base!</p>

<p>Heres my code!</p>

306,Why does my counter variable not come back to 0 in a multithreaded scenario?,"<p>I'm building a Windows Service base class to manages the polling off a schedule's table of any pending task and the running them.</p>

<p>The Windows service is using the <code>System.Timers.Timer</code> to start the schedule's table polling.</p>

<p>I'm setting the <code>ThreadPool.SetMaxThread</code> to 10 before initialising the timer.</p>

<pre><code>    protected override void OnStart(string[] args)
    {
        ThreadPool.SetMaxThreads(10, 10);

        this._Timer = new System.Timers.Timer();
        this._Timer.Elapsed += new ElapsedEventHandler(PollWrapper);
        this._Timer.Interval = 100;
        this._Timer.Enabled = true;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The delegate method called by the timer keeps the count of the running threads so that it can be used in the OnStop() method to wait for each thread to complete before disposing the service.</p>

<pre><code>    private void PollWrapper(object sender, ElapsedEventArgs e)
    {
        numberOfRunningThreads++;

        try
        {
            this.Poll(sender, e);
        }
        catch (Exception exception)
        {
            //some error logging here
        }
        finally
        {
            numberOfRunningThreads--;
        }
    }




    protected override void OnStop()
    {
        this._Timer.Enabled = false;

        while (numberOfRunningThreads &gt; 0)
        {
            this.RequestAdditionalTime(1000);
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Often, the service would not stop when I try to stop it from the Windows service management console. If I debug it and add a breakpoint to the OnStop() method I can see that it is not because the numberOfRunningThreads is stuck on a number greater than 0 (often much greater than 10!). No tasks are running and it stays on that number forever!</p>

<p>Firstly, I don't understand how that number could ever be greater than 10, despite the <code>ThreadPool.SetMaxThreads</code> should limit it to 10?</p>

<p>Secondly, even if I did not set the maximum number of threads, I would expect the finally block of the PollWrapper's to eventually bring the count back to 0. If the counter stays greater than 0, it can be explained only with the finally block not executing, right!? How that is possible?</p>

<p>And lastly, would you suggest a differently way to limit the Poll to a number of possible concurrent running threads to a fixed number (.NET 3.5)?</p>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>After reading Yahia's comments on reentrancy and SetMaxThread I have modified the PollWrapper so that it should always limit the max number of spawned running threads. I will still to make sure Poll is reentrant.</p>

<pre><code>private void PollWrapper(object sender, ElapsedEventArgs e)
        {
            lock(this)
            {
                if(this.numberOfRunningThreads &lt; this.numberOfAllowedThreads)
                {
                    this.numberOfRunningThreads++;

The first entity and the relationships between the first and second entity are maintained on the first tab of the screen and this seems to be working fine allowing me to delete the first entity instances and add/remove relationships between the first and second entities.</p>

<p>My problems are on the second tab where I maintain the second entity. They entities display fine and I can update their attributes, however, attempts to delete them results in a never-ending save loop.</p>

<p>I believe I have verified the loop by adding an NSLog entry into the willSave method of the second entity's NSManagedObject class.</p>

<p>The entities are displayed in NSTableViews backed by NSArrays (I haven't used binding).
I'm sharing the one managedObjectContext between the two tabs and the delete operation is simple (see below):</p>

<pre><code>int currentRow = [[tableView selectedRowIndexes] firstIndex];
NSManagedObject *targetObject = [self.array objectAtIndex:currentRow];
NSError *error = nil;
[managedObjectContext deleteObject:targetObject];
if (![managedObjectContext save:&amp;error]) {
   NSLog(@""Unresolved error %@, %@"", error, [error userInfo]);
   abort();
}

318,Most efficient way to add new keys or append to old keys in a dictionary during iteration in Python?,"<p>Here's a common situation when compiling data in dictionaries from different sources: </p>

<p>Say you have a dictionary that stores lists of things, such as things I like:</p>

<pre><code>likes = {
    'colors': ['blue','red','purple'],
    'foods': ['apples', 'oranges']
}
</code></pre>

<p>and a second dictionary with some related values in it:</p>

<pre><code>favorites = {
    'colors':'yellow',
    'desserts':'ice cream'
}
</code></pre>

<p>You then want to iterate over the ""favorites"" object and either append the items in that object to the list with the appropriate key in the ""likes"" dictionary or add a new key to it with the value being a list containing the value in ""favorites"".</p>

<p>There are several ways to do this:</p>

<pre><code>for key in favorites:
    if key in likes:
        likes[key].append(favorites[key])
    else:
        likes[key] = list(favorites[key])
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>for key in favorites:
    try:
        likes[key].append(favorites[key])
    except KeyError:
        likes[key] = list(favorites[key])
</code></pre>

<p>And many more as well...</p>

<p>I generally use the first syntax because it feels more pythonic, but if there are other, better ways, I'd love to know what they are. Thanks!</p>

<p>For example, if I have a grid made up of 1 inch squares, I would like all node coordinates to be a multiple of 72 (the number of points in an inch, if I'm not mistaken). I like the hierarchical layout of dot, so if possible, that's the tool I'd like to use.</p>

<p>The reason I've chosen GraphViz is that it can perform layout, then return that information as text. Other tools seem to just want to render a graph, but I want to render it elsewhere, and I just need to get the layout information.</p>

328,Virtualized Development Environments in Enterprise Networks,"<p>We are attempting to implement a development environment using virtualization for a small team of 4 developers within an enterprise organization.  This would allow us to set up separate development, testing, and staging environments - as well as allowing access to new operating systems that are requirements for systems or tools we are evaluating.   We re-purposed an existing workstation-class machine, threw in 24GB RAM and RAID-10, and were doing fine until we attempted to get the machine added to the domain.  </p>

<p>Now we are beginning the war that all enterprise developers since the beginning of time have had to fight - the fight for local control of a development and testing environment.  The network and IT admins' have raised concerns ranging from ""ESX Server is the enterprise standard"" to ""servers are not allowed on client VLANs"" to ""[fill-in-the-blank] is not a skill set currently possessed in the local or enterprise IT organization"".</p>

<p>We could justify production-class hardware and formal IT support if we had to, but it would take time and involve a whole lot of headache.  Even then it might take months to formally get IT resources assigned by treating this as a production system - and even if we did, we would likely lose the local control we need.</p>

<p>I imagine that many of you have had similar struggles over developer control of non-production environments - and virtualization in particular - so my questions are as follows:  </p>

<ol>
<li>What strategies and arguments have helped you win over the infrastructure (IT &amp; Network) folks to allow these types of silos to exist within enterprises which have standard network and security policies in place that would generally (and understandably) preclude this type of non-(centrally)-managed infrastructure?</li>
<li>Have you found this to be a matter of technical justification - or more of a political struggle for control and ownership?</li>
<li>If you ended up with a IT-managed development environment, how much of a roadblock has it been for day-to-day development and testing?</li>
<li>Has anyone ended up moving their development environment to a disconnected VLAN or entirely separate network to avoid these network access struggles?</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, this is not a Hyper-V vs. ESX holy war (we would be fine with either - but Hyper-V was selected since it is ""free"" with MSDN for these purposes [yes, VMWare has free tools too - but the good management tools generally aren't], and would be easier to manage by the local developers in a ""Microsoft Shop"") - so arguments for or against either are outside the scope of this question.</p>

<p>This is also less of a virtualization vs. physical hardware - I suppose the same question could be asked without the virtualization component to the equation.</p>

<p>Also assume that the dev team has already made assurances to either manage patch management and antivirus, or integrate with the existing enterprise systems if they will support it.
This scenario, with different questions, is also <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/316200/enterprise-network-it-admins-what-is-required-for-developers-to-run-their-own-vm"">posted on SF</a> to hopefully elicit the opposing viewpoint.</p>

347,Why does calling ob_flush() slow down my latency so much?,"<p>I am writing an application in PHP, and I decided to do some testing on my own to determine how well PHP handles buffers and buffering. Specifically, I wanted to see if manually calling <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> would have a huge effect on my program.</p>

<p>I conjured up 10KB of lorem ipsum and went to work. I put a timer in PHP at the start and end of a for loop that writes the 10KB of lipsum (in display:none div blocks) 100 times, for a total of 1MB of data, which I figured would be enough work that random CPU load wouldn't throw off my data too much.</p>

<p>Besides the PHP timer, I popped open Chrome's developer tools (F12) and recorded the ""time"" and ""latency"" field. If I have my terminology correct, the ""time"" is the total amount of time the page took to respond, and render, and ""latency"" is just the time until the page first received data from the server.</p>

<p>So here's the mystery: When I do nothing but write the 10KB of lipsum 100x, my averages are:</p>

<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.00630ms
Chrome Time: 565.6ms
Chrome Latency: 28.3ms
</code></pre>

<p>When I call <code>ob_start()</code> at the very beginning, and <code>ob_flush()</code> at the very end:</p>

<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.00792ms
Chrome Time: 540ms
Chrome Latency: 33ms
</code></pre>

<p>HOWEVER, and here's the mystery - <strong>when I call <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> at the beginning and end of each 10KB block of text, my Chrome-reported latency spikes by 4x.</strong></p>

<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.005814ms
Chrome Time: 624.7ms
Chrome Latency: 134.9ms ???
</code></pre>

<p>As far as I know, the chrome latency should be <strong>cut</strong> by 100x, since I'm flushing the buffer 1/100 of the way through the PHP output. I know that the <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> operate on a higher buffer, and they actually flush into a lower buffer, I would expect that lower buffer to flush at the same intervals, meaning I would see about the same latency.</p>

<p>My test rig is a very modest Intel ATOM netbook with Nvidia ION graphics, Windows 7 home premium (32-bit) and WAMPserver running Apache 2.2.22 with pretty much default settings. I used Chrome 24.0.1312.52 m. CPU load was moderate but not 100% during the tests, and my ram was nowhere near full.</p>

<p>I got a little trouble with the animations of android and i hope someone can help me with this one.</p>

<p>I created a Linearlayout and a listview.</p>

<p><em>The listView is placed in a relative layout because i had to set the translationY of an other linearLayout in the same relative layout but i keep that other linearlayout excluded from the question.</em></p>

<p>When someone <code>clicks or taps</code> on the linearlayout (that will act like a button) the listview will animate a little bit downwards with the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>animation_Fold = new TranslateAnimation(0, 0, 0, 150);
createNewAnimationListener(); //to monitor when the animation ends and starts.

animation_Fold.setDuration(300);
animation_Fold.setFillAfter(true);
listview_Contacts.startAnimation(animation_Fold); 
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see i create the animation, and it will move 150(pixels?) downwards.</p>

<p>Now there is some more code to animate the listview back to its original position but i think this is irrelevant to this question. (it's practically the same but then fromYDelta and toYDelta will be reversed.)</p>

<p>When i click on the listview (does not matter where i click) after it has been animated, it wil kick back to its original position.
But i used <code>.setFillAfter(true)</code>, so why is this happening to me? Because i just want the listview to hold its new given position. (the position of the animation)</p>

<p>I hope someone can help me with this to finish my animation because i got stuck at this one.</p>

366,Ubuntu: How to I add string to terminal window title from command line?,"<p>I am working on a Ubuntu VM where i have multiple terminal windows open at the same time. I switch between them many times and it's hard to keep track of which window has which purpose. So what I want to do is to issue some sort of command from the command line that would permanently alter the title of the window. One approach is to modify the following line in <code>.bashrc</code> to, say, add the word <code>FOO</code> to the title:</p>

<pre><code>PS1=""\[\e]0;${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\u@${InstName}:FOO:\w\a\]$PS1""
</code></pre>

<p>Then I would do <code>source .bashrc</code>. The problem is that I only have one <code>.bashrc</code> and many windows. So if I open two windows one after another without changing the line in <code>.bashrc</code>, I'll have <code>FOO</code> in both of them. So I want to issue a command from each window instead. How do I do that? </p>

<p>NOTE: The stuff around <code>FOO</code> in the <code>PS1</code> line above is important too, so what I want is to essentially add a window-specific string to the generic <code>PS1</code> specification above.</p>

367,"Rails 3: Chaining `has_many` relations with conditions on the last table, without excessive queries","<p>I am new to both DBs and Rails (using 3.2), and I suspect this is a basic question that I'm just having trouble finding an answer for.</p>

<p>I'm making an app that tracks articles people submit to journals. So, each user has a number of articles. For each article, they can submit it to a number of journals. The submission object itself keeps track not only of the article being submitted and the journal it's submitted to, but also the date it was submitted, the way it was submitted (email, online system, etc.), the date a response was received (if any), the response (if any) (e.g. accepted, resubmit, decline).</p>

<p>I'm trying to allow a user to view all of their outstanding submissions in one place. So, for each user, I'm trying to query the db to get all <strong>submissions</strong> belonging to <strong>articles</strong> that belong to that user, but only returning the submissions for which response is NULL (meaning there is no response yet, and thus the submission is still outstanding).</p>

<p>So my models are related like this:</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :articles
end

class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :submissions
end

class Journal &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :submissions
end

class Submission &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :article
  has_one :journal
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, for a given <code>@user</code>, I think I could do something like</p>

<pre><code>@articles_with_subs = @user.articles.joins(:submissions)
</code></pre>

<p>and then</p>

<pre><code>@out_subs = Array.new
@articles_with_subs.each do |article|
  outs = article.submissions.where(""response NOT NULL"")
  @out_subs.push outs
end
@out_subs.flatten!
</code></pre>

<p>I have &lt; 10,000 rows (might grow to 20k max) of data in a SQL table titled ""table"" with (for example) three fields FIELD1 (varchar) FIELD2 (text) FIELD3 (year4). note: real data includes about 10 to 15 fields and may change.</p>

<p>CURRENTLY CODE FUNCTIONS AS FOLLOWS:</p>

<p>The following code below (which I got by following a few youtube tutotorials) allows me to search all three fields with one keyword (e.g. ""dog""). If I type in two words into my search box (e.g. ""dog sled"") then one of the three fields must contain the exact phrase ""dog sled"" for any results to be returned at all.  So if one field has both ""sled"" and ""dog"" but not in that order the record will not be returned.  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php  

// Initialize the search output variable...

// See if the posted search field is set and has a value

if(isset($_POST['searchquery']) &amp;&amp; $_POST['searchquery'] != """"){

// Filter the search query user input

$searchquery = preg_replace('#[^a-z 0-9?]#i', '', $_POST['searchquery']);
$sqlCommand = ""SELECT * FROM `table` WHERE FIELD1 LIKE '%$searchquery%' OR FIELD2 LIKE '%$searchquery%' OR FIELD3 LIKE '%$searchquery%'"";

// connect to localhost database...

// search stuff and print out the results

$query = mysql_query($sqlCommand) or die(mysql_error());
$count = mysql_num_rows($query);
if($count &gt; 1){
$search_output .= ""&lt;hr /&gt;$count results for &lt;strong&gt;$searchquery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"";
while($row = mysql_fetch_array($query)){
$field1 = $row[""FIELD1""];
$field2 = $row[""FIELD2""];
$field3 = $row[""FIELD3""];
$search_output .= ""$field1, $field2, field3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"";
} } 
else {
$search_output = ""&lt;hr /&gt;0 results for &lt;strong&gt;$searchquery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whoops try another search..."";
} }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>IDEAL FUNCTIONING:</p>

<p>I would like to be able to type a few words into the search box and have the query look for each search word across all three fields.  Additionally I would like results with more matching words to be ranked (weighted) higher.  (e.g. a search with words ""dog sled 2005"" would give a higher rank to a query that found all three words somewhere across the three fields and give less weight to a query that found only two or one of the words.)
Finally, since my database is growing I would like to truncate the results so only 50 results are displayed for any search.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.  --Tim</p>

<p>UPDATE: I've addressed some early questions I got on this issue below...</p>

<p><strong>1) What are some examples of real-world data that can be found in [field1, field2, field3]? Would it be individual words or entire phrases/sentences/paragraphs?</strong></p>

<p>The real world data is about 15 fields including numbers, words, phrases, abbreviations, lists of words, and even paragraphs. They are for something like a library catalog of books and reports and less formal papers and documents.  Some fields and examples follow:</p>

<p>Year (e.g. 2010)</p>

<p>Season (e.g. fall)</p>

<p>First_name (e.g. William)</p>

<p>Last_Name (e.g. McShane)  note: would be great to accomodate appostrophes but not necessary e.g. O'reilly, can't, Smith-Jenkins.</p>

<p>Title (e.g. The economic decline of blah blah regions)</p>

<p>Description (e.g. this text addresses a wide range of issues on ... )</p>

<p>Classification (e.g. 4AB51-45)</p>

<p>Phone (e.g. 555-121-5444)</p>

<p>Email (e.g. jkr@ppp.com</p>

<p>etc... </p>

<p><strong>2. In the design you're looking for, does keyword order still matter? For instance, if field1 = ""I ate a souffle made from lobster"", and I search for ""lobster souffle"", should it work?</strong></p>

<p>I'm not so concerned with word order or even phrases.  There will likely never be more than 20,000 records in the entire database and at the moment there are only a few thousand so really a search for just two key words across fields would likely be enough to narrow most searches down to a dozen results.  With one key word though it is impossible.  there might be 1000 records with 2010 as the year so I can't even search by year without getting a flood of results.  The query just needs to find entries with all or some of the words with higher weight given to records that contain more of the keywords.  Most of the keyword searches will look for words often in different fields.  so i might type (2010 economic airlines Florida taxes) and hope to get records for a about 5 reports written in 2010 that dealt with the effects of taxation on the airline industry that were maybe published by authors in Florida or maybe Florida showed up in another field e.g. a Florida based airline, etc.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long winded response.  So, to answer the original question... If you search for ""lobster Souffle"" is should find a record with a Field1 entry of (I ate a souffle made from lobster).  Similary if field one contains (lobster) and field2 contain (souffle) it should find the record and weight it equally since it found two of the search words.</p>

<p><strong>And now two design questions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>3. Will you ever add a field4, field5, field6, and so on in the future? The reason I'm asking is that you may want to consider abstracting your search keywords into a separate 'search' table or something like that. It's not 'normalised' (if you're not familiar with the term, normalisation means designing your database so that no piece of data will ever be in two places) but it does make things much more efficient. I can explain that a little more later if you want.</strong></p>

<p>I will almost certainly add / remove fields in the future.  I don't know what normalization is.</p>

<p><strong>4. I see you're stripping out all characters that aren't alphanumeric (or the space); will you want to be able to deal with apostrophes (like ""wasn't"" or ""O'Ryan""), hyphens, and so forth?</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned above it would be great to deal with apostrophes and hyphens.  I only have the bit in there that strips those out because that is the way it was done for the example on YouTube that I got the idea from.  I don't think any search phrases will include words like ""isn't"" but might include authors with appostrophes like O'reilly or hyphens like Smith-Galviston.  And there will be middle initials too like ""George P. Scott""</p>

<pre><code>public IQueryable&lt;Restaurant&gt; All()
{
    return from r in _context.Restaurants select new Restaurant(r.Id)
        {
             Name = r.Name
        };
 }
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, Restaurant is a Models.Restaurant of course, and not _context.Restaurants.Restaurant.</p>

<p>Filtering in the service class (or in repository unit tests) against All(), this works just as expected:</p>

<pre><code>var results = Repository.All().Where(r =&gt; r.Name == ""BW&lt;3"").ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>This works just fine, has one Model.Restaurant. Now, if I try the same things with the pkid:</p>

<pre><code>var results = Repository.All().Where(r =&gt; r.Id == new Guid(""088ec7f4-63e8-4e3a-902f-fc6240df0a4b"")).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>If fails with:</p>

<pre><code>The member 'BurningPlate.Models.Restaurant.Id' has no supported translation to SQL.
</code></pre>

<p>If seen some similiar posts where people say it's because r => r.Id is [Model.Restaurants] is a class level the linq2sql layer isn't aware of. To me, that means the the first version shouldn't work either. Of course, if my pk is an int, it works just fine.</p>

<p>What's really going on here? Lord knows, it's not very intuitive to have one work and one not work. What am I misunderstanding?</p>

<p>I've seen some customized templates (<code>.cls</code> files), but they are indeed <code>templates</code> NOT <code>class</code>, as they somehow use the original class by <code>\LoadClass</code>.</p>

377,Spring Entity bean not known. Using new Spring 3.1 packagesToScan property and no persistence.xml,"<p>Another question for my EclipseLink and Spring (MVC and spring-data) version 3.1.1 set-up:</p>

<p>I'm trying to get JPA working without the use of the persistence.xml file in accordance with <a href=""http://www.baeldung.com/2011/12/13/the-persistence-layer-with-spring-3-1-and-jpa/"" rel=""nofollow"">this article</a>. In the article it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Usually, JPA defines a persistence unit through the
  META-INF/persistence.xml file. Starting with Spring 3.1, this XML file
  is no longer necessary – the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean
  now supports a ‘packagesToScan’ property where the packages to scan
  for @Entity classes can be specified.</p>
  
  <p>The persistence.xml file was the last piece of XML to be removed –
  now, JPA can be fully set up with no XML.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand that if one were making use of the persistence.xml file, all Entity classes here should be declared here. However, I'm trying to make use of the <code>packagesToScan</code> property instead. Below is the full startup log and the error produced after making one request to the servlet which ultimately attempts to create a new user in the database. It doesn't seem to recognise that the <code>User</code> object is an Entity. Since I have little experience with Spring, I was wondering if anyone, firstly can spot a mistake I'm making, but otherwise, knows the best way to debug this. I want to know what Entity objects have been recognised by the EntityManagerFactory.</p>

<p>My backup option is to switch to using persistence.xml (haven't tried it yet actually) but I'd like to be rid of that if possible (one less XML file to worry about).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've updated the error log after making the recommended config change to the entityManagerFactory, based on the answer by Sean Patrick Floyd but that did not solve the main issue. What I have also done is tried an alternative way of getting this to work by creating a persistence.xml file (the old and more common way of doing this) and added a small piece of test code within the servlet I access to kick off this functionality.
So now I have this bit of code in my servlet:</p>

<pre><code>User user = new User();
user.setFirstName(""John"");
user.setLastName(""Doe"");
// user = userService.addUser(user);

EntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(""proxiPU"");
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
em.getTransaction().begin();
em.persist(user); 
em.getTransaction().commit();
em.close();
emf.close();
</code></pre>

<p>And this persistence.xml file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" ?&gt;
&lt;persistence xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""

            &lt;property name=""eclipselink.jdbc.user"" value=""proxi""/&gt;

        &lt;/properties&gt;
    &lt;/persistence-unit&gt;
&lt;/persistence&gt;

<p>This actually works so I'm wondering now whether it's a problem with the way the EntityManagerFactory is initialised or something like that. I've included the code for the UserService class that is supposed to do the database related stuff. </p>

383,Datagridview - Can I save all rows at once?,"<p>I've created my dataset and tableadapters using Stored Procedures from a SQL database. </p>

<p>When coding the application, I have a variety datagridviews that populate when the user opens a particular record (most are sub-sets of data).  My problem arises during the save routine.  Because I am using SPs, my usual update line is something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Me.tbaSOMEDATASOURCE.UPDATE(FIELD1, FIELD2, FIELD3, FIELD4, etc)
</code></pre>

<p>While I could run the update on the row-validated event in the dgv, I'd rather hold all updates until the user selects the ""SAVE"" button.  This could result in a number of row updates in any one DGV.</p>

<p>Should I be looking to add a ""IsUpdated"" column to each DGV, then cycle back through and update each row by itself, or is there an easier way?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

384,How may a linked list be saved/loaded from a file efficiently using Objective-C?,"<p>After four weeks of learning Objective-C for the iPhone, my first useful application is almost finished. However, I still need to save several instance variables whenever the current view is changed and to reload them when the view is reopened.</p>

<p>I have no trouble loading variables with basic C types like <em>int</em> and <em>BOOL</em>, but am having difficulty with a linked list made of Objective-C objects.</p>

<p>The linked list consists of memory accessed by three pointers: <em>startPointer</em>, <em>currPointer</em>, and <em>endPointer</em>.
Each element consists of a <em>last</em> pointer, a <em>next</em> pointer, a pointer to a nested linked list (<em>nestedPtr</em>), and some variables.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to do the following in the loading code:</p>

<pre><code>//dataStorageObj will contain the values to be loaded
dataStorageObj = [[DataSaver alloc] init];
NSData *data =[[NSMutableData alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:[documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@""Archive""]];
NSKeyedUnarchiver *unarchiver = [[NSKeyedUnarchiver alloc] initForReadingWithData:data];
dataStorageObj = [unarchiver decodeObjectForKey:@""KeyForViewA""];
[unarchiver finishDecoding];
//****************************
//Simple variables loaded here
//****************************
//DataSaver is a class with methods to retrieve its instance variables
//The methods are named after the values they retrieve
startPointer = [dataStorageObj startPointer];
currPointer = [dataStorageObj currPointer];
endPointer = [dataStorageObj endPointer];
[unarchiver release];
[data release];
</code></pre>

<p>I placed a debug point at the end and all of the variables had the correct values. Actually accessing the values in the code (doing so in the console worked) resulted in *EXC_BAD_ACCESS* messages.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Next, I changed the linked list loading lines to the following:</p>

<pre><code>startPointer = [[PointerClass alloc] initPointerFromList:[dataStorageObj startPointer]];
currPointer = [[PointerClass alloc] initPointerFromList:[dataStorageObj currPointer]];
endPointer = [[PointerClass alloc] initPointerFromList:[dataStorageObj endPointer]];
</code></pre>

<p>The <em>initPointerFromList</em> method:</p>

<pre><code>-(PointerClass *)initPointerFromList:(PointerClass *)theList
{
    last = theList.last;
    nestedPointer = [[NestedPointerClass alloc] initNestedPointerFromList:theList.nestedPointer];
    //****************************************
    //Other variables loaded from theList here
    //****************************************
    if (theList.next != nil)
    {
     next = [[PointerClass alloc] initPointerFromList:theList.next];
    }

    return self;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem now was that the pointers were all pointing to individual linked lists, so I wrote methods to retrieve the start and end locations of the linked list referred to by currPointer:</p>

<pre><code>currPointer = [[PointerClass alloc] initPointerFromList:[dataStorageObj currPointer]];
endPointer = [currPointer lastElement];
startPointer = [currPointer firstElement];
</code></pre>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>My question is threefold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it necessary to use methods such as <em>initPointerFromList</em> to allocate memory for a loaded linked list?</li>
<li>Is there a more efficient way to maintain the relationship between <em>currPointer</em>, <em>endPointer</em>, and <em>startPointer</em> than by searching through the list using the <em>lastElement</em> and <em>firstElement</em> methods?</li>
<li>Is there something wrong with the techniques behind the loading code I have presented? Without it, I have no problems; with it, I still get *BAD_ACCESS* messages. I want to know if these messages are tied to the loading code or if to the way I have handled object allocation throughout the rest of my application.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

385,"Update multiple rows with different, optional values for different colums","<p>This is basically an extension of <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2528181/update-multiple-rows-with-one-query"">Update multiple rows with one query?</a>.  I want to be able to update multiple columns of multiple rows at a time, but not necessarily to update every column of every row.</p>

<p>Here is an example command I would like to be able to execute:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE person
SET name = CASE id
    WHEN 1 THEN 'Jim'
    WHEN 3 THEN 'Precious'
END,
sex = CASE id
    WHEN 1 THEN 'female'
    WHEN 2 THEN 'male'
END
WHERE id IN (1,2,3)
</code></pre>

<p>However this returns an error, telling me column 'name' cannot be null.  So it seem to me that specifying <code>WHERE id IN (x,y,z)</code> means all selected columns must be updated, even though we're indicating which values to place on a case by case basis.</p>

<p>Is there any way around this limitation, like a special notation to indicate ""keep the original value""?  If not, is there some other way to update select, arbitrary columns of multiple rows in one query?</p>

<p>But the webservers at  172.21.37.17 and 172.21.37.24 still didn't respond from the outside world.  Although I was able to PPTP VPN in on 10.10.39.10 (interface) which is the outside interface IP address. and it is static mapped to 172.21.37.20.</p>

393,CSS3 Transforms: Multiple Origins?,"<p>Is it possible to specify an origin at the top left (0%, 0%) for scaling, and a different origin (center) for rotation in CSS3?  I am only working with webkit, if that helps.</p>

<p>I am currently using a transform list (i.e. -webkit-transform: scale(newScale) rotate(newRotate)</p>

<p>but it seems like it isn't possible to change the origin in-between passes.  Is there a better way to look at this?  Presently, if I scale an object and rotate it with an origin at the default center, the position of the element is now off and so when you drag the element, the cursor is still at the top left of the element, whereas it should be at the center. Changing the origin to the center to scale it fixes this, but presents new problems with rotation and flipping.</p>

It came pre-installed with Windows 8 x64 and is taking advantage of UEFI out of the box. The BIOS (APTOS AMI) is in Secure Boot mode with the OS selected as ""Windows 8"".</p>

<p>I removed the stock HDD that came with the machine and put my own SSD into it. I created a Windows 8 Pro x64 installation disc on a 4GB USB flash drive formated as FAT32 since its apparently required for UEFI.</p>

<p>When I boot from the USB Win8 installation disc, I get suck when I reach the ""Custom: Install Windows only"" section. Normally you would see a list of available discs and their partitions, however my entire list is blank.</p>

<p>If I head back to the BIOS and disable Secure Boot and set the OS to ""Other OS"" and attempt again, I am able to see the list of available discs in the system and can install a copy of Windows 8. Unfortunately, doing it in this method results in an installation with a traditional 350 MB partition + OS partition instead of 4 partitions which is normal for a UEFI setup.</p>

401,Is it possible to have multiple cxf.xml files to configure separate parts of the system?,"<p>It seems interesting, that nobody asked this before. I have some ""basic""-questions about the configuration of CXF Clients.</p>

<p>We have a Tomcat running our application. This application needs to communicate with a WebService. The implementation of the client is done with CXF, and this implementation is packaged in a JAR-File. Lets say ""ws-client.jar"". It is possible and desirable, that there are other implementations of clients for other webservices, also using CXF. And each WS-Client should be packaged in its own JAR-File. So at the end I'll have our application WAR, containing all other ws-client*.jar I need.</p>

<pre><code>bigApplication.war:
  WEB-INF/lib/ws-client.jar
  WEB-INF/lib/ws-client2.jar
  WEB-INF/lib/ws-client3.jar
  ...
  WEB-INF/classes/**/*.class
</code></pre>

<p>And now the question: Where can/may I put the <code>cxf.xml</code>? Can I put a configuration file in each ws-*.jar? Can a put in addition another in the war file? Or only one <code>cxf.xml</code> file must exist? Which path in the archive is the best?</p>

<p>By now I just copy a configuration file in <code>tomcat/webapps/bigApplication/WEB-INF/classes/cxf.xml</code> (probably also not the best place for it). The problem is, I need to do that every time I deploy the application. And I want actually only to configure ws-client.jar, and not all CXF-WS-Clients. So I want to configure things as specific as possible, and in the write place.</p>

<p>Any answer is welcome, also Links to the right information, which I didn't find.</p>

<p>[UPDATE]
As it is a somehow long question, here the questions in the post together:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can I put a cxf.xml file in a jar-archive?</li>
  <li>Can more than one cxf.xml file exists per application? One in each relevant .jar file?</li>

405,Did medieval Russia reject islam because of its prohibition against alcohol?,"<p>Since a long time, I am aware of a historical anecdote about the attempt to convert Russia to islam. I don't know where I first heard the anecdote, I'm pretty sure it was oral, so I had to dig a bit to find notable claims. The anecdote goes something like this: a muslim emissary arrived at the czar to talk about islam. He talked about the religion, the rites, the position of women, etc. etc., and the czar sounded quite interested. He almost succeeded in convincing the czar, when he mentioned the ban on the consumption of alcohol. Then, the czar pointed out, islam could not be an option in Russia.</p>

<p>The Wikipedia page on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism_in_Russia"">Alcoholism in Russia</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Legend holds that the tenth-century Russian prince Vladimir the Great rejected Islam as a state religion for the country because of its prohibition of alcohol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...which is sourced from <em>Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)</em>. (I have no idea what that means.)</p>

<p>A semi-quoted reference on the Wikipedia page <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kievan_Rus%27#Reign_of_Vladimir_and_Christianisation"">Kievan Rus</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. The emissaries visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews and the Muslims, they finally arrived in Constantinople. <strong>They rejected Islam because</strong>, among other things, <strong>it prohibited the consumption of alcohol</strong>, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But, at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there, that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow.</p>

<ul>
<li>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980–1584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</li>
</ul>

406,ClassCastException with multiple wars deployed in Tomcat,"<p>I have two WARs deployed to the same Tomcat 7 instance, and both use CXF + WSS4J. The two apps communicate via SOAP, and WSS4J interceptors handle SAML assertions in the SOAP headers. When testing each war in isolation everything works fine, but when both apps are deployed and one app sends a SOAP message to the other, I receive the following ClassCastException:</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.ws.security.WSDocInfo cannot be cast to org.apache.ws.security.WSDocInfo
</code></pre>

<p>To me, this implies a class loader issue, but what in specific I cant figure out. Each app has its own copy of WSS4J in their respective WEB-INF/lib folders, and I don't see any WSS4J library in Tomcat's common libraries.</p>

<p>In production these two apps will most likely never use the same JVM let alone be in the same Tomcat instance, but I will feel more comfortable when I get to the bottom of this issue. It also helps to launch both apps from the same Tomcat instance in development. Does anyone have any ideas what the issue might be?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong>
I deployed each war in separate Tomcat instances that both use the same JVM and the ClassCastException goes away. Must be something I don't understand with Tomcat class loading?</p>

407,Is binding objects to angular's $rootScope in a service bad?,"<p>In angular, I have an object that will be exposed across my application via a service.</p>

<p>Some of the fields on that object are dynamic, and will be updated as normal by bindings in the controllers that use the service. But some of the fields are computed properties, that depend on the other fields, and need to be dynamically updated.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example (which is working on jsbin here: <a href=""http://jsbin.com/erudis/21/edit"">http://jsbin.com/erudis/21/edit</a>). My service model exposes fields <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> where <code>c</code> is calculated from <code>a + B</code> in <code>calcC()</code>. Note, in my real application the calculations are a lot more complex, but the essence is here.</p>

<p>The only way I can think to get this to work, is to bind my service model to the $rootScope, and then use $rootScope.$watch to watch for any of the controllers changing <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> and when they do, recalculating <code>c</code>. But that seems ugly. <strong>Is there a better way of doing this?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>A second concern is performance. In my full application <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are big lists of objects, which get aggregated down to <code>c</code>. This means that the $rootScope.$watch functions will be doing a lot of deep array checking, which sounds like it will hurt performance.</p>

<p>I have this all working with an evented approach in BackBone, which cuts down the recalculation as much as possible, but angular doesn't seem to play well with an evented approach. <strong>Any thoughts on that would be great too.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Here's the example application.</p>

<pre><code>var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);

//A service providing a model available to multiple controllers
myModule.factory('aModel', function($rootScope) {
  var myModel = {

412,Can a rational Bézier curve take exactly the same shape as a part of the sine function?,"<p>I'm wondering whether a rational Bézier curve could take <strong>exactly</strong> the same shape as a part of the sine function. The best way to check this seems like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find a part of the sine function such that there is no symmetry anymore in this part, e.g. from $\sin(0)$ to $\sin({\pi \over 2})$.</li>
<li>In that case, the control points for a quadratic Bézier curve follow from the sine function. Because a Bézier curve is tangent to the control polygon at the first and last points, this results in the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$ and $({\pi \over 2}, 1)$. The second point $(1,1)$ is the intersection of the two tangent lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>When plotting the above:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kLikv.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Which is pretty close, but I'm looking for an exact representation (if possible). Therefore, the next step is to look to a rational Bézier curve:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Df06R.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In this case I used the weights [1, 1.4, 1]. It is now a very close approximation for this part of the sine function, but it is not exact. </p>

<p>What would be a systematic way to do this? And if it fails for a quadratic rational Bézier curve, could it work for a cubic, quartic, quintic, ... curve?</p>

<p>I don't think it would be meaningful to look into Uniform Rational B-Splines (or Non-Uniform ones, NURBS) since they are just piecewise rational Bézier curves, right?</p>

<p>From the above coefficient table, bgrp1 and bgrp2 seem to make sense: bgrp1 represents the maternal lines with larger litter sizes, lighter offsprings, which results in lower rectal temperature (37.70 degrees C) of the offspring. On the other hand, bgrp2 represents the terminal lines with smaller litter size, heavier offsprings, which results in higher a rectal temperature (37.98 degrees C).
 I am just wondering, if the same could be done for psex1 and psex2, but what is presented in the table of coefficients could be due to what you said earlier. </p>

440,MySQL- get id of next insert,"<p>I am building a system whereby the user can build pages for a blog. The pages can contain images which obviously require manipulation and storage in folders. I am using the id of the SQL table row where the page data is stored as the basis for the folder name which stores the images for that page. The trouble is, sometimes this folder has to be created BEFORE the other page data has been inserted into the SQL table.</p>

<p>SO... how do I find what the ID of the NEXT insert will be?</p>

<p>I can't use the SELECT MAX(id) + 1 because pages may have been deleted in the meantime, reducing the max ID.</p>

<p>Any ideas? I am using codeigniter, so if anyone knows a library or method in CI that deals with this problem, that'd be ideal.</p>

<p>I COULD insert a dummy row, get the ID, delete it, then add one to the value, but seems like a bit of a hack?</p>

444,Change Mail from and display name with a filter action,"<p>I'm attempting to override the from display name and email address using wp_mail function. I am using the hook to modify wp_mail_from with my custom function using         add_filter('wp_mail_from','abcisupport_wp_mail_from'). If I hard code the value it'll return the address so it's wired up properly. If I use the argument, it returns the site network defaults. How can I pass in a value to the arguments (here: $email and $name) to my overriding functions?</p>

<pre><code>function abcisupport_wp_mail_from($email) {
  return $email; //returns our default site network email address
  /* return 'michael@site.com'; // returns  michael@site.com as the from address*/

  return $name; //returns our default site network display name

<p>Here,  6,5,5,4,4 means in the first roll you stop only when you get a 6; if you did not get a 6 in the first roll, then in the second roll you stop only when you roll a number 5 or higher (i.e. 5 or 6), etc.</p>

I would first like to ask if $x-a$ should actually equal $\pm (ub)^{1/2}$ (i.e., is it valid to ignore the minus sign, and why?). Applying this substitution,
\begin{align}
I &amp;=\int_0^\infty x \mathrm{e}^{-\frac{(x-a)^2}{b}}\, \mathrm{d}x \\
&amp;=\int_0^\infty x \mathrm{e}^{-u} \frac{b\,\mathrm{d}u}{2(x-a)} \\
&amp;=\int_{\frac{a^2}{b}}^\infty \left((ub)^{1/2} + a\right)\cdot{}\mathrm{e}^{-u} \frac{b\,\mathrm{d}u}{2(ub)^{1/2}} \\

I find that I am unable to evaluate the second term because the domain is from a non-zero constant to $+\infty$. Were the domain $[0,+\infty)$, the second integral would simply be a $\Gamma$ function. Seeing that the substitution I have attempted has not worked, could someone please propose an alternate route to evaluating this definite integral? Thank you.</p>

469,Best way for two apps on the same machine to communicate,"<p>I have an ASP.NET app running on a webserver. A third party is created another app in PHP which needs to send data to my app for processing.</p>

<p>Now it seems that the PHP app might be deployed on the same machine as my app. I like the fact that using HTTP (as opposed to say direct database access), the PHP app needs to know nothing at all about how my app works. But using the public internet seems silly for communication between two apps on the same machine.</p>

<p>In the Memory section, I see a section called Modified (orange) </p>

<p>The official description is: Memory whose contents must be to disk before it can be used for another purpose.</p>

<p>But I am still confused. What kinds of memory is Modified? In which case can we say that this number of memory is Modified? Can anyone give me a specific example?</p>

<p>Is the following guess correct?</p>

<p>When a program want to write something into disk, it actually write the content to an IO buffer, which is in the memory. After OS flush this area of memory into disk, the memory is modified or standby?</p>

479,Android GridView not updating,"<p>I have a GridView arranged in a 3x4 matrix, each item in the GridView is a FrameLayout containing an ImageView and a Textview.  Initially the TextViews are set to display the letter ""X"".  When clicked on, the letter is changed to ""Y"".</p>

<p>It works on all the GridView items except the first one.  If I click on the first one (top left) then nothing happens, no matter how long I wait.  If I then click anywhere else on the Android emulator screen (even outside the GridView itself), at that point the top left GridView item changes to ""Y"".  </p>

<p>I have a gut feeling it is something to do with the fact that ""getView"" in ""ImageAdapter"" is being called several times with ""position=0"" before the GridView is rendered, the sequence is as follows:</p>

<p>0
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
0</p>

<p>Now maybe that's just how Android works, I don't know, but it seems strange.  If anyone can help me out I'd appreciate it so much.</p>

<p>UPDATE: it appears the problem is related to ""MyView=convertView"" in getView(), if I simply remove this and always create a new View (as if convertView is null always) then the problem no longer exists.  Now I don't think this solution will be an issue as I don't use scrolling and the number of Views created should be 12 (i.e. a 3x4 GridView), but if anyone can explain the correct solution to the problem it would help a lot, thanks.</p>

481,"From a ruby developer's perspective (minimalist coder, etc), what is the most efficient way to deal with javascript on rails 3?","<p>I've recently been watching some screencasts in order to get a feel for the javascript programmer perspective and coding process, and have been a little frustrated, especially coming from a ruby background, seeing all of this stuff done by hand, and with such odd naming conventions!</p>

<p>So there is CoffeeScript, which I'm looking at with a fair amount of interest. Then there is RJS, but then Rails 3 has pulled support for that and I don't want to learn an outdated method. Then there is Go, which I'm not sure has enough support yet and just don't know enough about yet. Then of course all along here most of the time here there's jquery.</p>

<p>But should I even use jquery? Can I get around writing javascript entirely? Would/could the circumvention attempt be fruitful? I'm not asking for a therapy session or a bashing session, so if you're wound up like that please don't post here. I'm actually intrigued by javascript. If only because all of the ""cool"" programmers are talking about functional languages now.</p>

<p>But I don't want to waste my time. And all I really need to have is a robust way for passing information from rails/active-record to the javascript in a variety of ways. And I need to know what I'm doing with javascript. In fact that's mainly all I need to do. I need to be able to look at javascript, or coffeescript, or go, or whatever, and see it like I see ruby, which looks like an orchestra if it's written right.</p>

<p>So my questions are these:
a.) It seems like a lot of javascript tutorials are produced by javascript programmers who don't know what exactly it is they are doing. What are some good tutorials that involve a developer going over code, thinking aloud (CORRECTLY) about Javascript? Also rails+javascript materials. Sorely lacking. There is not a single book out on Rails 3 + Javascript, which is crazy because so much has changed since 2006's ""Ajax on Rails"". What resources do you know of other than ""lots of time""? 
b.) RJS, Coffeescript, etc v. Javascript + Jquery (or alt.)
What are the weaknesses of using the 'higher-level' abstracted languages and what are the benefits. And most importantly for me, a rails user, <strong>what is the solution that is most likely to be compatible with rails 2 years from now??</strong> RJS sounded like a great idea. But it used prototype right? Is there an ""RJS"" which is Rails 3 ready?</p>

<p>** And, again, guys, the book issue. Seriously this is a nice little opportunity for a knowledgable rails/javascript developer. Nothing has been released by the major publishers explicitly on Rails and Javascript since 2006!!! That is just astonishing.</p>

<p><a href=""https://myserver.com/stuff.cgi?db=mydb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://myserver.com/stuff.cgi?db=mydb</a></p>

<p>I want to create an NSURL object which, if passed to UIApplication's canOpenURL and openURL methods, will result in appropriate behavior.</p>

<p>Is this possible?  If so how?  And are there security issues I should be aware of?</p>

<p>EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION:</p>

<p>The following code produces a URL request which, when sent to the server, successfully causes app to download the file.  But what I want to do is open it with openURL.</p>

<pre><code>+ (NSMutableURLRequest *) requestForFileNamed: (NSString *) filename {
    NSString *url = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@&amp;user=%@&amp;getbinfile=%@"", serverLocation, username, filename];
    NSString *body = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""password=%@"", password];
    return [XMLRequestBuilder postRequestWithURL:url body:body];

485,Casting to a derived type in a LINQ to Entities query with Table Per Hierarchy inheritance,"<p>I have a LINQ to entities model with Table Per Hierarchy inheritance. I have a query over the base type, and I want to do specific type-dependent logic. For example:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?MethodSwizzling"">MethodSwizzling</a> is modifying the mapping so that calling selector A will actually invoke implementation B.  One use of this is to extend behavior of closed source classes. </p>

<p>Can we formalise the risks so that anyone who is deciding whether to use swizzling can make an informed decision whether it is worth it for what they are trying to do.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Naming Collisions</strong>. If the class later entends its functionality to include the method name that you have added, it will cause a huge manor of problems.  Reduce the risk by sensibly naming swizzled methods.</li>

<p>If I run the daemon manually when the system is running everything works fine.</p>

<p>However, I can't figure out how to tell the Fedora 13 init system ""run radvd on boot but <strong>only after</strong> wlan0 is up"". wlan0 is managed by NetworkManager and it would be nice if I could keep it that way.</p>

<p>I tried enabling <code>radvd</code> on boot using the GUI <code>system-config-services</code> tool; then <code>radvd</code> tries to start in the boot process (after NetworkManager) but fails because wlan0 does not exist.

<p>Usually when the camera focuses on a subject, one or a number of AF points are shown in the viewfinder outlined in black. Under certain circumstances the AF points flash orange once just as it achieves focus before they turn black. I've suspected that this might mean that focus was not properly achieved, yet the focus confirmation indicator in the bottom right of the viewfinder is solid and not flashing. According to the manual, that means that focus has been positively achieved.</p>

508,Revision Tracking Graph,"<p>Define the Revision Tracking Graph (RTG), which is an oriented graph (without circles) where each node x has a set C(x) associated with it. C(x) contains all edges on all paths from a node 0 ( C(0) = {} ). Each edge can be in a set at most once!</p>

<p>You can also describe this data structure by the rules for its growth:</p>

<ol>
<li>Start with node 0 with associated empty set <code>C(0) = {}</code> = <em>creating new object</em></li>
<li>For any node x create a new node y where (x,y) is oriented edge from x to y and <code>C(y) = C(x) union { (x,y) }</code> = <em>versioning and branching</em></li>
<li>For any nodes f and t, create node r, where (f,r) and (t,r) are oriented edges and <code>C(r) = C(f) union C(t) union { (f,r), (t,r) }</code> = <em>merging</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: You can see there is no mathematical difference between creating new version and a branch. It is a semantical difference depending on whether there is already an edge leading from the node or not. </p>

<p><strong>Base node</strong> is defined as a node b, such as <code>C(b) = C(f) intersect C(t)</code>, where f and t are nodes representing two versions to be merged. </p>

<p><strong>Simple Merge equation</strong> <code>Result=To + (From-Base)</code> = means that if we subtract every edge in C(b) from C(f) and add all edges in C(t) we get a resulting C(r) minus (f,r) and (t,r) edges exactly. No edge would appear twice and all edges in C(f) and C(t) would be represented. = <em>3-way merge</em></p>

<p><strong>Complex merge equation</strong> <code>Result = To + Sum(i=1..n) for (Fi-Bi), where Fn = From</code>. Each edge can be in exactly one of the sets To, (Fi-Bi). For n=1 this turns into a simple merge equation. In case there exist no base in simple case, we might find sequence of F,B nodes to fit the complex equation. <em>(1+2n)-way merge</em></p>

<p>I have actually several questions pertaining to this data structure. I am posing the first 3 for ""frame of mind"", as I already know the answers. And I believe question 4 directly leads to answering question 5, which I really try to get answered.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>Prove there can be no circles in the graph</li>
  <li>Prove that for certain graphs there are such nodes F,T for which base cannot be found as specified in simple equation.</li>
  <li>Create algorithm to find B in simple case where n = 1.</li>
  <li>Prove that for each RTG and each pair of nodes F and T, there is a set of n pairs of nodes Fi,Bi, where i=1..n to fit the complex merge equation.</li>
  <li>Create algorithm to find minimum n and Fi,Bi for i=1..n where n > 1.</li>

510,Multithreaded server using threadpool,"<p>I'm planing a multithreaded server (SCGI to be precise). Now, I know that the traditional approach using one thread per connection is not very scalable. I also don't want to use something fancy like libevent, as this is a hobby project and I prefer not to have lots of dependencies in my codebase.</p>

<p>The approach I'm thinking of is to use a threadpool and let one thread listen to the network to queue up any request coming in. The threads managed by the pool then dequeue the requests, receive the data and respond respectively.</p>

<p>This way, I wouldn't have the overhead of constant thread creation while still being able to serve many request in parallel.</p>

<p>Is there some fundamental problem in this architecture design that I'm not aware of or is this a not-ideal-but-still-ok solution?</p>

513,Pass object pointer in drag/drop operation,"<p>Is it possible to pass the pointer to an object in a drag and drop operation?</p>

<p>Here is the scenario...</p>

<p>I have an 'NSArray' of custom objects. For arguments sake we'll say this is a list of person objects.</p>

<p>The list is tied to an <code>NSTableView</code> via an <code>NSArrayController</code>. The <code>NSTableView</code> is a drag source and I have an <code>NSView</code> as a drag destination.</p>

<p>When implementing drag and drop I can easily get the name of the currently selected person(s) from the <code>NSArrayController</code> as an <code>NSString</code> in the drag process and pass it to the receiver in the <code>NSView</code>. </p>

<p>However, I would like to be able to pass a pointer to the person object so the receiver has access to the entire object.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be that the drag operation creates a new instance of a person object and does not make a reference to the selected person object despite implementing the required methods in the person model. As a result I get a person object at the destination, it just isn't populated with the data from the object.</p>

<p>I ideally I want the object pointer because the NSView will make use of the object reference in order that any updates to the object itself are reflected in both the <code>NSView</code> and the <code>NSTableView</code> (and everywhere else the object is used).</p>

<p>Is it even possible to use the object reference in a drag and drop operation or do I need to pass some custom reference that is an iVar of the person object and then do a lookup once it arrives at the destination? (This would seem a little archaic to me considering how much object referencing Obj-c has).</p>

<p>I understand that a target could accept a drag operation from outside the application, but specifying the operation as a local operation would account for this would it not?</p>

<p>I've checked the apple docs but still don't seem to be able to find an answer.</p>

532,UIPickerView that looks like UIDatePicker but with seconds,"<p>I am making a timer app and needed to display hour, min and seconds to the user. I tried using <code>UIDatePicker</code> but it shows only hours and mins as selections. Not seconds. After doing a bit of research online I found that there is no way to get seconds in <code>UIDatePicker</code> and I had to write my own <code>UIPickerView</code> from scratch. </p>

<p>So my question is, is there sample code for such i.e. someone wrote a <code>CustomUIPickerView</code> for hours, min and secs that I can incorporate in my project? <code>UIDatePicker</code> has a nice overlay of Hours &amp; Mins text that stays put while the user rotate the dials. It would be nice if someone added that in their custom picker too. I prefer not to write a custom <code>UIPickerView</code> from scratch if I don't have to. Thank you.</p>

549,How to remove elements by substrings from a STL container,"<p>I have a vector of objects (objects are term nodes that amongst other fields contai a string field with the term string)</p>

<pre><code>class TermNode {
private:
    std::wstring term;
    double weight;
    ...
public:
    ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>After some processing and calculating the scores these objects get finally stored in a vector of TermNode pointers such as</p>

<pre><code>std::vector&lt;TermNode *&gt; termlist;
</code></pre>

<p>A resulting list of this vector, containing up to 400 entries, looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>DEBUG: 'knowledge' term weight=13.5921
DEBUG: 'discovery' term weight=12.3437
DEBUG: 'applications' term weight=11.9476
DEBUG: 'process' term weight=11.4553
DEBUG: 'knowledge discovery' term weight=11.4509
DEBUG: 'information' term weight=10.952
DEBUG: 'techniques' term weight=10.4139
DEBUG: 'web' term weight=10.3733
...
</code></pre>

<p>What I try to do is to cleanup that final list for <em>substrings</em> also contained in phrases inside the terms list. For example, looking at the above list snippet, there is the phrase <strong>'knowledge discovery'</strong> and therefore I would like to remove the single terms <strong>'knowledge'</strong> and <strong>'discovery'</strong>, because they are also in the list and redundant in this context. I want to keep the phrases containing the single terms. I am also thinking about to remove all strings equal or less 3 characters. But that is just a thought for now.</p>

<p>For this cleanup process I would like to code a class using remove_if / find_if (using the new C++ lambdas) and it would be nice to have that code in a compact class.</p>

<p>I am not really sure on how to solve this. The problem is that I first would have to identify what strings to remove, by probably setting a flag as an delete marker. That would mean I would have to pre-process that list. I would have to find the single terms and the phrases that contain one of those single terms. I think that is not an easy task to do and would need some advanced algorithm. Using a suffix tree to identify substrings? </p>

<p>Another loop on the vector and maybe a copy of the same vector could to the clean up. I am looking for something most efficient in a time manner.</p>

<p>I been playing with the idea or direction such as showed in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5869573/stdlist-erase-incompatible-iterator"">std::list erase incompatible iterator</a> using the remove_if / find_if and the idea used in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3487717/erasing-multiple-objects-from-a-stdvector"">Erasing multiple objects from a std::vector?</a>.</p>

<p>So the question is basically is there a smart way to do this and avoid multiple loops and how could I identify the single terms for deletion? Maybe I am really missing something, but probably someone is out there and give me a good hint. </p>

<p>Thanks for your thoughts!</p>

<p>I could'nt use the C++11 lambda syntax, because on my ubuntu servers have currently g++ 4.4.1 installed. Anyways. It does the job for now. 
The way to go is to check the quality of the resulting weighted terms with other search result sets and see how I can improve the quality and find a way to boost the more relevant terms in conjunction with the original query term. It might be not an easy task to do, I wish there would be some ""simple heuristics"".
But that might be another new question when stepped further a little more :-)</p>

553,Shared Variables and Garbage Collection,"<p>I've been doing some reading on garbage collection in .NET and I was hoping for some clarification. So, as I understand it if I declare a public shared class variable, the GC will never get rid of it. Is this correct?</p>

<p>Also, what then of private variables? Take the following example:</p>

<pre><code>public class myClass
    private shared myString As String

    public sub ChangeString(newString As String)
        myString = newString
    end sub
end class
</code></pre>

<p>Would the shared variable now get GCed if there were no instances of the class? And what if I alter ChangeString to be a shared sub?</p>

555,Rails clone or hash?,"<p>Hey,
  i need to use current_user model in order to perform some calculations inside a function. Inside the function i need to do something like current_user.name = 'whatever', thus changing the current value of name.</p>

<p>However, i want that change to be local, only done inside that function. Since Rails uses objects though, it's a problem. So i'm thinking, what is the best thing to do ? </p>

<p>Maybe clone current_user to a new object and use that inside the function ? This seems expensive.
Or maybe creating a hash out of a model ? And if i do that, the actual model will not be changed ?</p>

<p>EDIT: It seems that hash works, but there is no type associated with it, so if i do something like :</p>

<pre><code>@attacker = current_user.attributes
</code></pre>

<p>then, to use it, i have to specify to_s like (else i get a nil error for some reason):</p>

557,Does a long internal stylesheet affect SEO?,"<p>I'm building a site with a lot of similar css between pages. I've decided that a good approach would be to have the css generated as strings by php functions (with parameters) and outputed as an internal stylesheet in every page that i serve. The benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>this way if i make a change it will reflect throughout the entire site without having to maintain duplicates</li>
<li>i can send only the necessary css for a certain page</li>
<li>it's better than having small css files and sending a lot of css headers at inclusion</li>
<li>the possibility that the content might be displayed before the stylesheet is loaded is gone</li>
<li>i can calculate dimensions by using parameters</li>
<li>i can create a layer that will minify the result received from these functions or serve cached minified css</li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't seen this done anywhere else unfortunately so i'm thinking that this might be because of SEO. The generated internal stylesheet will be at around 15kb max (before minifying the stylesheet).</p>

<p>I need your opinion on this approach and your thoughts about the impact a long internal stylesheet will have on SEO.</p>

<p>I have gone through all the steps (multiple times) here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/999313/iphone-app-signing-a-valid-signing-identity-matching-this-profile-could-not-be"">iPhone app signing: A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain</a></p>

<p>I have deleted all keys and profiles, created all new, created new App IDs (I have a ton of these now that I can't delete). I've been through numerous online articles and they all say to try the same thing: delete, re-create, and reinstall keys and profiles. That's just not working for me.</p>

<p>Please help, I'm at wits end.</p>

580,Capistrano Multiple Servers: How to refer to current server during deploy?,"<p>Some background, I am capistrino running 2.9.0 and capistrano-ext 1.2.1.  Multistage deployment is working as expected.  As is adding arrays of server to the roles.</p>

<pre><code>INSTANCES = [""this.server.com"", ""that.server.com""]
role(:web) {INSTANCES}  
</code></pre>

<p>I've been trying to make :deploy_to produced a path based on the name of the server being deployed, like so:  </p>

<pre><code>set :deploy_to, lambda { ""/var/www/application/$HOSTNAME"" }
</code></pre>

<p>This is working pretty well, except this.server.com and that.server.com are actually the same host.  In this example, instead of having two deploy folders based off the server names defined in my deploy/stage.rb file, it just produces the one /var/www/application/server.com/</p>

<p>I've been digging around looking for a way to either inject this at the capistrano level or reference a shell variable that would retain these details.  It seems like needing to host an application server with multiple instances of an app would be common.    </p>

<p>The commented out <code>$.ajax()</code> method is what I was trying originally, but quickly discovered <code>$.get()</code> was a better method for what I was trying to do. But regardless of which method I use the code works fine in desktop browsers (FF,IE,Chrome), but does not complete successfully in the Android browser.</p>

<p>When I use <code>$.ajax()</code>, and I test in the Android browser it first hangs for several seconds, and then the error callback fires and I get:</p>

<p>Error submitting results! [object][object]</p>

<p>I should also note that when I enable the java console in the Android browser, it does not indicate any errors with the JS.</p>

<p>So it occurs to me that the script is not able to find/load <code>inc/check_stid.inc.php</code> for some reason. But why only in the Android browser?</p>

606,Getting Metadata From Audio Server,"<p>I am using Matt Gallagher's <a href=""http://cocoawithlove.com/2009/06/revisiting-old-post-streaming-and.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Guide</a> on Streaming Audio From a URL.  One thing that he talks about very briefly is in regards to getting metadata of what is currently being streamed.  This talk though is frankly over my head for where I am at right now, and was wondering if someone could break down what he is meaning by this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The easiest source of metadata comes from the HTTP headers. Inside the handleReadFromStream:eventType: method, use CFReadStreamCopyProperty to copy the kCFStreamPropertyHTTPResponseHeader property from the CFReadStreamRef, then you can use CFHTTPMessageCopyAllHeaderFields to copy the header fields out of the response. For many streaming audio servers, the stream name is one of these fields.</p>

<p>I would like to search all posts in my system. The posts fulltext index is an amalgamation of the post title and post body. </p>

<ol>

<li>create a second table (posts_search) with a post_id and tsvector column containing the index data. </li>

    &lt;Errors/&gt;
&lt;/MyNewRoot&gt;

<p>Note that N2: prefix for the children of Order is not there after the XSL transformation. Also additional xmlns="""" in the Order header (for some reason). I couldn't figure out putting the ns: prefix for the rest of the elements (like Errors and List). </p>

<p>First of all, why would I need to put the prefix for the children if the parent already has it. Doesn't the parent namespace dictate the children nodes/attribute namespaces?  </p>

622,Streamline Active Directory account creation via automated web site,"<p>In my company we have high employee turnover, and hence our helpdesk receives about a dozen requests per week for new Active Directory accounts.  Currently, we receive these requests simply via e-mail or voice-mail, and rarely do we have all of the information necessary to create the account.  I would like to find a web application that can be used by a manager or supervisor to formalize the requests they make for AD accounts for new employees under their command.  Ideally, the application would prompt for all of necessary information, and allow the helpdesk to review the requests and approve or deny each one.  If approved, the application would take care of creating the account and send an e-mail to the manager.</p>

<p>The question does not include a body for $f(x)$ or a table of values/graph for the output of f(x), so can this question be answered?</p>

<p>I know that:
$$\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b)-F(a),$$
will evaluate the integral across a given interval, but the question is asking what the average value of f(x) is, not its integral.</p>

Options Page allows user to save setting about your Extension. Visual Studio handle a lot of work for us. </p>

<p>I created the Options Page.</p>



<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public class VisualStudioParameter : DialogPage
{
    private string _tfsServerUrl = DefaultParameter.TfsServerUrl;

    [Category(""TFS Parameters"")]
    [DisplayName(@""Server Name"")]

    {
        get { return _tfsServerUrl; }
        set { _tfsServerUrl = value; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>First, I created a method in the Visual Studio Package to acces to the Options Page.
Okay so now, from my Package, I can easily acces to the settings.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>partial class SpecFlowTfsLinkerExtensionPackage : Package : IParameter
{
    ....
    ....

    public string GetTfsServerUrl()
    {
        return ((VisualStudioParameter) GetDialogPage(typeof (VisualStudioParameter))).TfsServerUrl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I want to be able, in another library (Another project, included in the VSIX Package), to get easily these values. I don't want to reference the Visual Studio AddIn Package in my library.</p>

<p>I also have Unit Test so I'm going to create an Interface. During Unit Test, I going to Mock the object.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public interface IParameter
{
    string GetTfsServerUrl();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Do you have any idea about how I can develop a clean solution to get these parameters from another assembly ?</p>

<p>Do you think the better solution is to inject the AddIn dependency in my library ?</p>

<p>If you already developed a Visual Studio Extension, How did you encapsulated the user setting from your core assembly ?</p>

655,Fundamental Objective-C question...driving me crazy,"<p>Its been a long time since I've done any programming.  Used to be 'ok' at reading C &amp; C++...never wrote much.</p>

<p>I have an extremely simple Class that I want to use to manipulate the contents of an Array (using <code>NSMutableArray</code>).  The Array needs to persist as an Object so I can make multiple updates to it during a single run of my program (not worried about storing state data to disk yet) </p>

<p>Here is my problem.  I am not clear on where/when I should Alloc/Init my Array object so that it will be in a usable state each time a button is clicked on my iPhone's View.</p>

<p>I am trying to create a SubClass of <code>ViewController</code> that includes an Array as an instance variable, which can then be referenced in the code that responds to button clicks from the View. I've tried 3 approaches</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I've tried to just reference the array instance variable in a method I've written as part of the same class. No Alloc/Init anywhere in this version of code.  When I call the addObject function it appears to fail because the array object has not been allocated/initialized.</p></li>
<li><p>I've also tried to Alloc/Init an instance of my array object in the <code>viewWillDisplay</code> method.  The Xcode compiler complains that my newly allocated object is never used.</p></li>
<li><p>For kicks, I've done an alloc/init within the scope of the 'button click' method i'm writing...but of course that allocates a new instance each time I click my button.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Here is what I've got in the <code>.h</code> and <code>.m</code> files for my example (this shows scenario 1)</p>

<p>Would really appreciate it if someone could fill in the GIANT blank I've obviously got in my understanding of how Instance Variable objects are supposed to be used. (I've read a wide variety of Apples docs on Obj-C..etc.  Also googled my brains out trying to find an explanation.</p>

662,Change the XPath-root of an XmlDocument in .net (C#)?,"<p>When selecting from an XmlDocument by e.g. the XPath-method SelectSingleNode we get an XmlNode that consist of the first matching node, lets call it &lt;node1&gt;. If we do further selection on &lt;node1&gt; then one might expect that the XPath-root now is this node, but this is incorrect, the root is still the same as in the original XmlDocument. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>XmlDocument xd = new XmlDocument();
xd.LoadXml(@""&lt;root&gt;
                 &lt;subroot&gt;
                     &lt;elm&gt;test1&lt;/elm&gt;
                     &lt;elm&gt;test2&lt;/elm&gt;
                     &lt;elm&gt;test3&lt;/elm&gt;
                 &lt;/subroot&gt;
             &lt;/root&gt;"");
XmlNode xnSubRoot = xd.SelectSingleNode(""/root/subroot"");

//This is the XPath I want to be able to use, but it returns null.
XmlNode xnElm = xnSubRoot.SelectSingleNode(""/subroot/elm"");

//This works, but the XPath-root is the same as in the original document.
xnElm = xnSubRoot.SelectSingleNode(""/root/subroot/elm"");
</code></pre>

<p>Is there any way to ""fix"" the root of xnSubRoot so that I can use the XPath I want? The reason for my question is because I have a case where I'm calling a webservice that returns an XmlNode where the OuterXml-property shows a structure of ""/Data/SubElement/..."" and so on, but when running XPath ""/Data"" then null is returned, only ""/SubElement"" works, i.e. the XPath-root seems to be one level lower than the actual document-root.</p>

<p>I'm sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this, or that I'm missing something vital. However I really can't seem to find anything, even though I've read <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d271ytdx(VS.80).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d271ytdx(VS.80).aspx</a>.</p>

<p>N.B. I do realize that it would be possible to use the XPath ""//subroot/elm"", but then I might also get other elements further down in the XML structure.</p>

668,"""Selecting"" or ""Wrapping"" an IQueryable so that it is still queryable","<p>I have a Class / API that uses an <code>IQueryable&lt;FirstClass&gt;</code> data source however I wish to expose an <code>IQueryable&lt;SecondClass&gt;</code>, where <code>SecondClass</code> is a wrapper class for <code>FirstClass</code> that exposes nearly identical properties, however for various reasons needs to inherit from an unrelated base class.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>// My API
void IQueryable&lt;SecondClass&gt; GetCurrentRecords()
{
    return from row in dataSource
           /* Linq query */
           select new SecondClass(row);
}

// User of my API
var results = GetCurrentRecords().Where(row =&gt; row.Owner = ""Mike"");
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can make the above compile simply by using <code>AsQueryable</code> however I want to expose a ""true"" <code>IQueryable</code> that efficiently queries the database based on the API users query.</p>

<p>I know that this isn't trivial (my wrapper IQueryable implementation needs to understand the relationship between the properties of <code>SecondClass</code> and <code>FirstClass</code>), and that it has nothing to do with the <code>Select</code> function, but it <em>seems</em> like it should be possible.</p>

<p>How do I do this?</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I know that instead my API could just expose <code>FirstClass</code> along with a helper method to convert <code>FirstClass</code> to <code>SecondClass</code> for when the API user is ""done"" creating their query, but it feels messy and I don't like the idea of exposing my generated classes in this way.  Also I'd like to know how to do the above anyway just from a purely academic standpoint.</p>

<p>Reversing and KeyGen is very interesting but I'm a beginner and my questions are probably very dumb but I will be very thankful if you could help me.</p>

<p>Until the moment I have reversed simple keygen applications using techniques such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Look for string text reference to find the interesting code area.</li>
<li>Keygen fishing.</li>
<li>And bypass IsDebugPresent check.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah, I know, really basic stuff. Here is a video similar to what I do in general…</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJY_Tv7o5bE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJY_Tv7o5bE</a></p>

<p>Just for learning sometimes I try to reverse a few small and medium application that I buy for Windows and looks like simple products without many protections.</p>

<p>This is a software that I acquired 2 months ago and the whole installation is around 50MB. One of the motivations to try apply my basic knowledge here is because I like to see if what I learned in keygens really work in real-life, my experience that medium softwares are much harder since keygens are very small and easy to find the routines that you want. :)</p>

<p><strong>* Just to keep it very clear, I have a license for this program and my intention is only learn and increase my knowledge. Since I have no commercial intention in break it or create any damage I will not disclosure the application - I hope you understand. *</strong></p>

<p>OK, let's go. The application consist of one main executable (~33MB), 6 DLLs (very small ones and some of them are libeay32.dll, etc) and around 90 .xsd files (XML format). My first step was try to identify the programming language used and if a packer was present, please, see screenshots below:</p>

<p><a href=""http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/3982/01exeinfodetection.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/3982/01exeinfodetection.png</a></p>

<p>It really appears to be developed in Delphi, with CFF I confirmed it. Also, there is no section that points for an packer looking at CFF information and EXE Information and RDG also say it's clean. However, RDG found IsDebugPresent and pointed for an protection software as you may see. However, I'm not sure if it's a false-positive. </p>

<p>On my application the serial is entered in a field like that:</p>

<p>And once I enter a wrong serial number (30 chars long) I get a message like that:</p>

<p>I guess it's not a MessageBox, or at least it's very custom one. For this kind of messages should I keep breakpoints at MessageBoxA, etc? Or there is a different API?</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot once I attach to the application running:</p>

<p>Additionally, I noted that are parts of the application when some texts are not stored as a ""TextString"", instead I see ""char by char"" in sequence at OllyDb creating a few strings (also not very useful to me).</p>

<p>If I define a breakpoint in any of these TextStrings it's what happen - an exception:</p>

<p>Is it a protection? Any idea how to bypass it?</p>

<p>From here the only thing that I'm able to do it pass control to the application and all is over. :(</p>

<p>Also, if I refuse to pass control to the application and I continue with F7/F8 I get something like that:</p>

<p>It ends with an instruction not recognized by OllyDB. Any idea?</p>

<p>I also tried to set breakpoints in Names from User32.dll such as GetDlgItemTextA and GetDlgItemTextW since I believe they are the APIs used to read my entered serial number. The strange thing is that they are exported and not imported as demonstrated below. Is it normal?</p>

683,How to use Netbeans platform syntax highlight with JEditorPane?,"<p>There are many tutorials online giving very complex or non-working examples on this. It seems that people recommend others to use the syntax highlighters offered by netbeans but I am totally puzzled on how to do so!</p>

<p>I have checked many many sites on this and the best I can find is : 
<a href=""http://www.antonioshome.net/kitchen/netbeans/nbms-standalone.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antonioshome.net/kitchen/netbeans/nbms-standalone.php</a></p>

<p>However I am still not able to use this example (as it is aimed to people who don't want to use the Netbeans platform but just a portion of it) and I am still not sure if I can 
just use syntax highlighting in a simple plug 'n play way. For example netbeans supports
several language highlights by default, can I just use the highlighters in a JEditorPane to parse Ruby/Python/Java for example ? or do I need to write my own parser :-| ? </p>

<p>I will really appreciate a small simple example on how to plug syntax highlight in a standalone application using the netbeans platform. </p>

689,Serving images through HTTP. Load balanced highly available architecture,"<p>I'm planning a system for serving image files from a server cluster with load-balancing. I'm battling with the architechture and whether to save the actual image files as blobs in the database or in filesystem.</p>

<p>My problem is that, the database connection is required anyways as the users need to be authenticated. Different users have access only to contents of their friends and items uploaded by themselves. Since the connection is required anyways, maybe the images could be retrieved from there aswell?</p>

<p>Images should be stored with no single point of failure. And obviously, the system should be fast.</p>

<p>For database approach:
The database is separate from rest of my application, so my applications main database won't get bloated by all the images. Database would be easy to scale as I just need to add more servers to the cluster. Problem is, that I've heard this might be a slow system from a website with millions, even billions of photos.</p>

<p>For filesystem:
I would be really interested in knowing how could one design a system, where the webservers are load balanced, and none of them is too important for the overall system. All the servers should use a common storage, so they can access the same files in the cluster.</p>

<p>What do you think? Which is the best solution in this case?</p>

<p>What kind of overall architechture and servers would you recommend for a image serving cluster? Note: This cluster <em>only</em> serves images. Applications servers are a whole different story.</p>

<p>I am new enough at Java that I don't get the point of <em>nesting</em> these calls to add 'jobs' to the EDT, and I'm not 100% confident with fiddling with these calls either. I think I understand what the <em>invokeLater</em> call does, and what each step does. Please correct me if this understanding is wrong:</p>

<p><em>invokeLater</em> is used to add some <em>invocation</em> to the list of jobs to be done in the Event Dispatch thread. Java then deals with when/how each invocation is done, ensuring that the EDT and in turn the GUI doesn't lock as it performs jobs 'in the background'.</p>

<p>Nesting these calls says to me that we should queue a set of jobs, one of which is to queue something, which will queue some jobs....one of which is to queue something. But the first inner invocation is only ever queued once the previous job is done. Everything occurs sequentially (this is in line of my understanding of the whole process), but I don't see why you would use nested requests to queue jobs to do so. I would have, if I was writing this from scratch, have simply created functions for each invocation and called them in turn.</p>

<p>I recognise, being only a novice at Java I am probably missing something huge that makes this nesting important. But there is no documentation of this, and no commenting in the code about the nesting.</p>

<p>What am I missing? What, if anything is the point in this code?</p>

701,Has a Dependent Type always a Type?,"<p>I am experimenting with dependent types. Lets assume the following 
short notation:</p>

<pre><code>(px:A.B)      The product type
(A -&gt; B)      The product type when x does not occur in B
</code></pre>

<p>Now according to the generalized type system a triple (s1,s2,s3) regulates
the formation of product types. We have the following formation rule:</p>

<pre><code>G |- A : s1   D, x : A |- B : s2
-------------------------------- p-rule
   G, D |- (px:A.B) : s3
</code></pre>

<p>In the examples I have seen, the sorts are always atomic. Would it be possible
to have a dependent sorts s2?</p>

<p>The question came up, when I tried to model the formation rule as a dependent
type itself. My idea was that (px:A.B) is a shorthand for a lambda expression
where p is some predefined constant:</p>

<pre><code>  px:A.B   = p A (lx:A.B)
</code></pre>

<p>The following p's work:</p>

<p>1)   p of type (py:o.((y -> o) -> o))</p>

<p>it does the same as the triple (o,o,o), and thus says that
if a is a proposition and b is a proposition, then a -> b is
also a proposition (implication). This is how it works:</p>

<pre><code> |- p : (py:o.((y -&gt; o) -&gt; o))  |- a : o       a : o |- a : o
 ---------------------------------------       --------------------
 |- (p a) : ((a -&gt; o) -&gt; o)                    |- (a -&gt; a) : a -&gt; o
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
                       |- (p a (a -&gt; a)) : o
</code></pre>

<p>1)   p of type (py:i.((y -> o) -> o))</p>

<p>it does the same as the triple (i,o,o), and thus says that
if x from some set A and B(x) is a proposition, then (px:A.B(x))
is a proposition (forall quantifier). This is how it works,
assuming q : nat -> o:</p>

<pre><code> |- p : (py:i.((y -&gt; o) -&gt; o))  |- nat : i     x : nat |- (q x) : o
 -----------------------------------------     ---------------------------
 |- (p nat) : ((nat -&gt; o) -&gt; o)                |- (lx:nat.(q x)) : nat -&gt; o
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       |- (p nat (lx:nat.(q x))) : o
</code></pre>

<p>But I don't see how it should work when s2 is dependent. That s2 is
dependent would mean that we have:</p>

<pre><code> D, x : A |- B : s2(x)
</code></pre>

<p>Have some logical systems where s2 is dependent already been studied?
What would be the formation rule?</p>

<p>I guess we cannot go along with p : (py:s1.((y-> s2(x)) -> s3)) 
because x has not the right scope.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

In the process I've noticed the Windows executable tends to pick up on subtle bugs in my code, crashing the program.

An example bug in my code is writing pass an array by 1 element.</p>

712,Unwanted evaluation in assignments in Mathematica: why  it happens and how to debug it during  the package-loading?,"<p>I am developing a (large) package which does not load properly anymore.
This happened after I changed a single line of code.
When I attempt to load the package (with Needs), the package starts loading and then one of the  setdelayed definitions “comes alive” (ie. Is somehow evaluated), gets trapped in an error trapping routine loaded a few lines before and the package loading aborts.<br>
The error trapping routine with abort is doing its job, except that it should not have been called in the first place, during the package loading phase.
The error message reveals that the wrong argument is in fact a pattern expression which I use on the lhs of a setdelayed definition a few lines later.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>……Some code lines

Changed line of code 

g[x_?NotGoodQ]:=(Message[g::nogood, x];Abort[])

……..some other code lines

g/: cccQ[g[x0_]]:=True
</code></pre>

<p>When I attempt to load the package, I get:</p>

<pre><code>g::nogood: Argument x0_ is not good
</code></pre>

<p>As you see the passed argument is a pattern and it can only come from the code line above.</p>

<p>I tried to find the reason for this behavior, but I have been unsuccessful so far.
So I decided to use the powerful Workbench debugging tools .</p>

<p>I would like to see step by step (or with breakpoints) what happens when I load the package.
I am not yet too familiar with WB, but it seems that ,using Debug as…, the package is first loaded and then eventually debugged with breakpoints, ect.
My problem is that the package does not even load completely! And any breakpoint set before loading the package does not seem to be effective. </p>

<p>So…2 questions: </p>

<ol>
<li>can anybody please explain why these code lines ""come alive"" during package loading? (there are no obvious syntax errors or code fragments left in the package as far as I can see)</li>
<li>can anybody please explain how (if) is possible to examine/debug
package code while being loaded in WB?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you for any help.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>In light of Leonid's answer and using his EvenQ example:
We can avoid using <code>Holdpattern</code> simply by definying upvalues for g BEFORE downvalues for g</p>

<pre><code>notGoodQ[x_] := EvenQ[x];
Clear[g];
g /: cccQ[g[x0_]] := True
g[x_?notGoodQ] := (Message[g::nogood, x]; Abort[])
</code></pre>

<p>Now</p>

<pre><code>?g

Global`g

cccQ[g[x0_]]^:=True



g[x_?notGoodQ]:=(Message[g::nogood,x];Abort[])



In[6]:= cccQ[g[1]]

Out[6]= True
</code></pre>

<p>while</p>

<pre><code>In[7]:= cccQ[g[2]]

During evaluation of In[7]:= g::nogood: -- Message text not found -- (2)

Out[7]= $Aborted
</code></pre>

<p>So...general rule: </p>

<p>When writing a function g, first define upvalues for g, then define downvalues for g, otherwise use <code>Holdpattern</code></p>

<p>Can you subscribe to this rule?</p>

<p>Leonid says that using <code>Holdpattern</code> might indicate improvable design. Besides the solution indicated above, how could one improve the design of the little code above or, better, in general when dealing with upvalues?</p>

<p>It used to work just fine, but replaced only the first occurrence of the OldLinePart on each line of the file specified by FilePath, with the Replacement. That is when I added the repeat loop. The logic is that <code>Pos()</code> returns 0 when no more occurrences are found. Then it should go on to the next line. The truth is however, that the loop keeps going infinitely and I have no idea why. I tried adding a <code>Break</code> statement in the <code>else</code> clause of <code>if FoundAtPos &gt; 0</code>, but no luck...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Obviously it is getting late. I was replacing the OldLinePart with a very long string... that contained the same word. </p>

<pre><code>static void Main() {
    AppDomain ad = AppDomain.CreateDomain (""NewDomain"");
    Thread t = new Thread (delegate() { ad.DoCallBack (SomeMethod); });
    t.Start();

    MethodInfo myMethod = tipo.GetMethod(@""StartDLL"");
    object obj = Activator.CreateInstance(myType);
    Thread thrBase = new Thread(new ThreadStart(delegate() { myMethod.Invoke(obj, null); }));
    thrBase.Start();

728,"Should we always eliminate calculated attributes, even when it is a critical and complicated calculation?","<p>The ""third normal form"" of database design asks you to remove functional dependencies. It  seeks to eliminate redundancy, removing from a table any attributes (fields) that can be calculated from the other fields. For instance, when you make a reference to another entity, you only store its key. You don't store replicas of attributes from these referred entities, because that would mean having to update them every time you change the referred entity.</p>

<p>Another situation is an attribute such as height. You want to know the height of a person, but in your application you may like to know it in different units: meters, feet, astronomical units. But you don't store all of these values, you should remove calculated fields, so you only leave one of them (meters, of course), and you calculate the transformed values ""on the fly"", when you need it.</p>

<p>You also don't store something like age, you calculate them from date of birth. In this case the fact that age changes with time also plays a role. If you don't do this your data will soon be incorrect, unless you keep updating it constantly.</p>

<p>Now suppose you have a social network that displays the astrological sign of each user. For each user we display his or her sign, which is calculated from the date and time of birth, and also from the astrological tradition of the user's choice (e.g. Western or Chinese). Calculating someone's sign is a pretty specialized and involved calculation, but is nevertheless something you can just call from an astrological library and calculate. How would you design this database, would you remove this functionally dependent attribute, or would you calculate the user's sign once, or every time she updates her date of birth, then store it in the database and forget about the possibility of calculating a sign in the rest of your system, or would you enforce the ""3NF"" rule with an iron fist? And how do you see the potential benefit of being able to tweak a user's sign if she insists that her sign should be different from the one that your algorithm is calculating?</p>

<p>Now suppose a new application. You are building a system for the Army, that chooses possible occupations for new conscripts. Part of your system is a huge bad-ass pattern recognition machine, developed at ORNL, that tells you what occupations will be allowed for the conscripts, based on a whole lot of data that comes from your database. This pattern recognition method looks at each person's height, date of birth, medical records, school transcript, and it also looks at a long list of answers the person gave to one of two questionnaires. It also takes in consideration evaluation questionnaires filled by higher-rank officers, and the analysis that is made looks at all of the conscripts from each year at the same time, to come up with a bunch of parameters for, say, a feed-forward neural network. This neural network is simpler than the whole of the pattern recognition system, but it is still a pretty involved calculation, not just a temperature unit conversion. Nevertheless, you can see it as a ""black box"", and it can tell you the fate from each of your conscripts when you pull his record form the database.</p>

<p>At a specific date in the Army's calendar, the analysis is made, the ANN parameters are found, and now you can run the black box and tell each conscript what he will be doing for the next one year or two. It's a pretty important thing. You will be deciding people's occupations, you will be sending some people to operate ovens at the kitchen, and other to drive tanks. Everyone will be logging in the Army's network to check out their occupations, and see the result in their personal webpages.</p>

<p>Now, the little black box is there, and it outputs this important value based on the attributes pulled from your database. The attributes and parameters will probably never change, and the calculation of the conscript's destiny will probably be always correct, always the same value form the first day. But would you really leave that outside the database, just to follow the ""remove calculated attributes"" rule?</p>

<p>This is not just some calculation of age, astrological sign or temperature conversion. The pattern recognition system is indeed a path to calculate an attribute. But would you really like to keep that inside your system forever, re-calculating this hugely important thing over and over again? Or would you consider it better to calculate everything once, and forget that this magical black box exists? I mean, just run all of this crazy pattern recognition code <em>once</em> some day, then pick the results, and record them in the database. When someone logs in to see the output from his analysis, make it so the query is just a boring data-fetching procedure, and leave all the pettern recognition ""excitement"" for another time.</p>

<p>Another more palpable situation: You run a web store like Amazon. You have a pattern recognition method to recommend books to people, that is fed from a user's record in your DB. Would you keep running the thing all the time you need the current recommendations, or would you treat the pattern recognition box as something separate from the rest of the system, just feeding its results to the database from where it can be read by other programs? Wouldn't it be nice to have a control, for example, to make sure that you are not switching recommendations at an awkward moment?... Don't worry too much about computational burden, assume excellent memory and computational resources.</p>

<p>TL;DR -- Do you think the rule of removing calculated attributes should never be broken, or would you say it is OK to store in the database the results from very important attributes, that are calculated by very complex and delicate pattern recognition methods? Aren't there situations where we should just pretend that you actually cannot perform the calculation ""on demand"", and just leave recorded there these results, that won't be updated anyway?</p>

<p>A customer is booking a hotel</p>

<p>Customer booking dates - 17/02/2011 to  26/02/2011</p>

<p>Normal price (All year) - 01/01/2011 - 31/12/2011 (price per day :$30.00)</p>

<p>Special Offer 1 dates - 01/01/2011 to 19/02/2011 (price per day :$20.00)</p>

<p>Special Offer 2 dates - 17/02/2011 to 24/02/2011 (price per day :$10.00)</p>

<p>In the above scenario, the proposed algorithm should work out the cheapest offer that the date ranges overlap and work out the price for the booking. If there is no special offer available it uses the normal price.</p>

<p>So for the first two days the system should get the price from ""special offer 1"" as it's the cheapest available price. Next 5 days should be ""Special offer 2 price"" and for the next 2 days it'll be normal price.</p>

742,"Including TikZ image (with external inputs) inside adjustbox adds horisontal spacing, why?","<p>I'm working on my masters thesis and so I have a bunch of tikz files that I want to include in the thesis. This I do by using adjustbox to limit the size to <code>\textwidth</code> as such

<p>Now my problem is that I have created external files containing common draw commands in order to creating multiple UML like diagrams and memory diagrams easier... this however, for some reason, adds padding to the including picture! Why, and what can I do to avoid it?</p>

<p>Now, this listview is populated using a custom adapter, which takes two arrrays of Strings to fill in the necessary data. What I'd like is to have a small row of buttons inflate when the user taps on the listview item, but of course, only below that specific row, here's the code I used to attempt this: </p>

<pre><code>private View.OnClickListener myCustomListener = new OnClickListener() {

    @Override
    public void onClick(View v) {
        if (stub == null) {
            //get the reference to it
            stub = (ViewStub) v.findViewById(R.id.controls_stub);
        }
        if (stub.getVisibility() != View.VISIBLE) {
            //inflate and make visible if not already
            stub.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);       
        }               
        else if (stub.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE) {
            //if visible, then toggle visibility back to gone
            stub.setVisibility(View.GONE);
        }
    }
};

@Override
public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
    View row = convertView;
    ViewHoldermHolder;

    if (row == null) {
        row = mInflater.inflate(R.layout.list_item, null);
        mHolder = new ViewHolder();
        mHolder.mName = (TextView) row.findViewById(android.R.id.text1);
        mHolder.mPicture = (ImageView) row.findViewById(R.id.friends_picture); 
        row.setTag(mHolder);
    }

    else {
        mHolder = (FriendListViewHolder) row.getTag();
    }

    mHolder.mName.setText(names[position]);
    FacebookHelper.setProfileImage(row.getContext(), mIds[position], mHolder.mPicture);
    row.setOnClickListener(myCustomListener);

    return row;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem I am running into is that since I am inflating the stub for that row, every certain (10 in my Gnexus case) rows, there is one with the items highlighted - when it should have only been one. For example, if there are 40 list items, row 1, 10, and 40 will have the stub inflated when the user only tapped item one. </p>

<p>How would I show it only for the row specified, and have it not affect further views when it's reusing the same row?</p>

<p>There are many, many pages describing how to convert a single-project repo, but far fewer for multi-project repos.  In fact, I've only <a href=""http://veys.com/2010/07/24/migrating-multi-project-subversion-repositories-to-git/"" rel=""nofollow"">found</a> a <a href=""http://daneomatic.com/wp/2010/11/01/svn-to-multiple-git-repos/"" rel=""nofollow"">few</a>, and they all seem to assume that each project has its own trunk:</p>

<pre><code>project1/
    branches/
    tags/
    trunk/
project2/
    branches/
    tags/
    trunk/
project3/
    branches/
    tags/
    trunk/
</code></pre>

<p>Regrettably, <em>my</em> Subversion repo looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>branches/
    *empty*
tags/
    project1-0.9/
    project1-1.0/
    project1-1.0.1/
    project2-0.9/
    project2-0.9.1/
    project3-0.5/
trunk/
    project1/
    project2/
    project3/
</code></pre>

<p>Worse, the tags are all created from the working copy (e.g. <code>svn copy . svn://example.com/svn/tags/project1-1.0.2</code>), so include small changes never commited to the trunk (mostly hard-coding version numbers).  Also, there are a handful of commits which span all projects (license updates, etc.).  Thankfully, at least, there are no merges!</p>

<p>Is there a clean way to untangle these projects while keeping my tags?  If it helps, this would be a one-way conversion, with the Subversion repo taken offline afterward.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it normal to have php-cgi this large?</li>
<li>Is it possible to estimate php-cgi memory usage based on settings?</li>
<li>Any tips for reducing memory consumption of php-cgi processes?</li>
</ul>

<p>Searching for known memory leaking bugs didn't yield anything relevant. And I'd be surprised if the default Debian packages/config had such an obvious memory leak. Other users on the same host do not have this problem.</p>

<p>What I've done so far is set <code>PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS</code> to a low value so that php-cgi processes are recycled quickly. When I use <code>ab</code> to simulate high load, this works very well. Processes die quickly before they grow higher than 10MB. However, under low-to-medium load, all processes grow steadily (because of load balancing) and most of them consume 28MB+ simultaneously, putting my VPS at risk of swapping. Please note than even without any sort of traffic, the processes grow steadily.</p>

<p>I can reduce the number of php-cgi processes, but this feels like a workaround more than a fix. I'd be surprised if php-cgi normally grew like this.</p>

<p>Also, summing the total RSS numbers for php-cgi processes gives:</p>

<pre><code>$ ps -C php-cgi -o rss= | awk '{s+=$1}END{print s/1024}'
195.738
</code></pre>

<p>Yet, <code>free -m</code> gives the following output:</p>

<pre><code>             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:           360        351          8          0         33        190
-/+ buffers/cache:        127        232
Swap:          255          0        255
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Am I missing something? How come the used memory (without buffers) is lower than the total resident memory of php-cgi processes on the host?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have the following PHP extensions:</p>

<p>php5-cgi
php5-common
php5-curl
php5-gd
php5-mysql
php5-xcache</p>

<p><code>xcache.size</code> is set to 24M. It used to be 32M but reducing it didn't help. <code>xcache.var_size</code> is set to 0. The remaining plugins are using the stock configuration. The xcache admin pages shows that xcache is using less than 1MB.</p>

<p>PHP's <code>memory_limit</code> is set to 32M.</p>

<p>Here is my FastCGI config:</p>

<pre><code>fastcgi.server    = ( "".php"" =&gt;
  ((
    ""bin-path"" =&gt; ""/usr/bin/php-cgi"",
    ""socket"" =&gt; ""/tmp/php.socket"",

759,"WCF REST client with TransferMode=Streamed - logging entire (""raw"") http requests/responses","<p><em>This is on .Net 4, full framework.</em></p>

<p>I'm trying to make a simple winforms app that will make some simple WCF REST calls.  It's using ChannelFactory and the service contract interface.  Of the ~20 methods in the interface, 2 of them involve Stream (an upload and a download method) so the service side (and currently also the client side) using TransferMode=Streamed.</p>

<p>My goal is to include the full HTTP request and response (much like you would see in ethereal/wireshark, or fiddler, or whatever), with headers, in a textbox of the winforms app (just to show what went over the wire)</p>

<p>In trying to use the built-in diagnostics (via SvcConfigEditor) and my own (via implementing IClientMessageInspector and then IEndpointBehavior to add the inspector, then channelFactory.Endpoint.Behaviors.Add to add the behavior :), I'm having 2 issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>When doing request.ToString() or reply.ToString() in BeforeSendRequest and AfterReceiveReply, it only gets the 'body' and not the headers.  Digging around in the objects in the debugger it looks like the reply has them in reply.Properties[""httpResponse""], but the request's request.Properties[""httpRequest""] has an empty Headers property even though Fiddler shows headers for Content-Type, Host, Accept-Encoding, and Connection.  It seems like there's likely a better way to get the 'raw' message that I'm missing (and if there's not, someone probably knows an existing chunk of code to 'reconstruct' the raw one from the Message)</li>
<li>Since the transfer mode is Streamed, the 'body' part just shows up as the string '... stream ...', both in SvcTraceViewer (and the 'raw' svclog - even with logEntireMessage=true) and when doing a ToString().  If the mode is Buffered instead, it shows the actual body fine.  I tried making a copy with reply.CreateBufferedCopy(int.MaxValue); but that then caused the actual WCF call to fail with an InvalidOperationException: This message cannot support the operation because it has been copied.</li>
</ol>

<p>One fallback would be to move the client to Buffered and just change to StreamedRequest for the one upload call and StreamedResponse for the download call (but I'd have to do that programmatically AFAICT, as it's set at the binding level in the config and I don't see anyway of doing it via attributes on the calls), which would take care of the 'body' part and leave me with just the ""get the http request headers"" (issue #1, specifically request.Properties[""httpRequest""].Headers being empty) to deal with, but I'm hoping there's some way of logging the 'raw' messages without doing so, leaving the TransferMode as Streamed.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This works fine, it installs all the latest stable versions, just as it is supposed to.</p>

<p>Next, I add a bundle -> <a href=""https://packagist.org/packages/kunstmaan/admin-bundle"">https://packagist.org/packages/kunstmaan/admin-bundle</a></p>

<pre><code>""require"": {
  ""php"": ""&gt;=5.3.3"",

</code></pre>

<p>This bundle depends on ""doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle"" in ""dev-master""(https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/doctrine-fixtures-bundle)</p>

<p>And that bundle depends on doctrine/data-fixtures with * (https://packagist.org/packages/doctrine/data-fixtures)</p>

<p>Now when i run composer update in the project, it tells me that there is nothing to satisfy the doctrine/data-fixtures dependency. Either a typo in the name, or no ""stable"" version available since the minimum-stability defaults to stable.</p>

<p>It does want to install the doctrine-fixtures-bundle in ""dev"" stability, since putting dev-master automatically puts this dependency in ""dev"" stability. But this does nothing for the deps of this dep, they keep wanting to install as stable since that is my minimum-stability.</p>

<p>At this point i can fix this, by adding doctrine/data-fixtures: dev-master or with @dev to my composer.json in the project. </p>

<p>But since this is only one example (knpmenubundle, fosuserbundle, etc etc) i will have to manually go and add all deps of deps that don't install to my own composer file.</p>

<p>Another solution would be dropping minimum-stability of my project to dev, but at that time all my deps, including the stable ones like Symfony2, will install their dev version and not the tagged release.</p>

779,Is there a general method to determine if a laptop can support 2x external monitors?,"<p><strong>Question:</strong>  Is there a general method, which would let me determine if a laptop can support 2x external monitors?</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong>  I’m shopping for a laptop, which would support my 2 main modes of operation.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In <strong>desk mode</strong>, I do many hours of design work with OrCAD, Altium, SolidWorks, Visio; also write code in Visual Studio and Eclipse.  For that, I’d like to have 2x large external monitors.  If needed, monitors can be connected through dock station.  If it's possible to choose between portrait and landscape orientation of monitors, that would be a bonus.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>field mode</strong>, I still need to run CAD packages, but only to look-up and tweak things occasionally.  Field mode happens in vanilla indoor environments, so ruggedness and ingress protection are not needed.  It would be nice if the laptop had a small footprint, like a 13” laptop perhaps.  At the same time, weight and thickness of the laptop are not a problem for me.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, I also wonder if this is realistic at all.<br>
<strong>Update:</strong>  I'm checking looking into <a href=""http://www.matrox.com/graphics/en/products/gxm/dh2go"" rel=""nofollow"">Maxtor DualHead2Go</a>, which was suggested in several other threads.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Found something curious.  The hp 120W Advanced Docking Station has 2x DisplayPorts (<a href=""http://h18000.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/13449_na/13449_na.HTML#HP%20120W%20and%20230W%20Advanced%20Docking%20Stations"" rel=""nofollow"">source</a>).</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/M46Mg.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Item 11 on the drawing.  Sounds like there ought to be an hp laptop, which would do 2x external monies.  Could these DisplayPorts be daisy chained inside docking station?</p>

  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9438043/php-false-place-in-condition"">php false place in condition</a>  </p>

<p>I have noticed that a lot of PHP code uses conditional statements like CONST == VARIABLE. I grew up with the syntax always articulated in reverse. Is there a reason for this structure? </p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code> // this is the way I see it most typically represented in PHP
 if ( false == $foobar ) { // do this }

 // this is the way I normally do it
 if ( $foobar == false ) { // do this }
</code></pre>

782,java.util.UUID.fromString not checking length,"<p>When I looked into the implementation of <code>java.util.UUID.fromString</code>, I found that it doesn't check for the UUID length. Is there any particular reason for this? It only checks the components separated by ""-"".</p>

<pre><code>String[] components = name.split(""-"");
        if (components.length != 5)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid UUID string: ""+name);
</code></pre>

<p>Should it also throw IllegalArgumentException when length is not 36?</p>

<p>Currently, without the length checking, numbers are automatically prepended with 0's if less than the component length or shifted if more. The downside is, if one entered a UUID string with a missing digit, it is accepted as valid and prepended with 0. This is hard to debug.</p>

<p>For example, this ""12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789ab"" becomes ""12345678-1234-1234-1234-0123456789ab"". Notice the '0' added? And this ""12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abcd"" becomes ""12345678-1234-1234-1234-23456789abcd"" with the '1' removed.</p>

<p>To push this even further, the string ""1-2-3-4-5"" will also be treated as valid and becomes ""00000001-0002-0003-0004-000000000005"".</p>

<p>Edit: To clarify my question, is this a bug or done on purpose to follow some standard or principle?</p>

And basically everything is working, except: UNAVAILABLE presences, i.e., when a user leaves a chat room, seem to be ignored. Presences from users entering the group chat are fine.</p>

<p>Both my local Openfire server as well as a xmpp client (Instantbird) tell me that there is a UNAVAILABLE presence when user leaves. Only my stuff has troubles.</p>

<p>Here's the main snippet of my code. In short, when a user (re-)enters the room I see the console output (""presenceListener.processPacket""), when a user leaves nothing happens.</p>

<pre><code>public boolean join(String room, user) {

    this.chat = new MultiUserChat(this.xmppConn, room);

    this.presenceListener = new PacketListener() {
        @Override
        public void processPacket(Packet packet) {
            System.out.println(""presenceListener.processPacket"");
            if (packet instanceof Presence)
                // Handle presence

Well, I do not have these services installed and I think it is not necessary since the application was working with oldMailAddress. Hereby I attach the code that I use, I hope anybody might help.</p>

800,Understanding the binary xls file-format,"<p>I'm trying to read the contents of a xls-file without the use of any xls-libraries but having problems doing so.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use information I found <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg615597.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. It has a little step-by-step instruction of how to read the file.
Also using this <a href=""http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/B/E/0BE8BDD7-E5E8-422A-ABFD-4342ED7AD886/Excel97-2007BinaryFileFormat%28xls%29Specification.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">xls-file-specification</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I even do this step correctly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3, Open the Workbook stream and scan for the first instance of a BOF record. This is the beginning of the Globals substream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the file-specification or this page with a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd908813%28v=office.12%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">list of the record-numbers</a>, I should be looking for for 2057(0809h) but the whole file doesn't contain that record anywhere(also using a hexa-editor when trying to find it).
But then I read this part on page 20 in the specification:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Byte Swapping Excel BIFF files are transportable across the
  MS-DOS/Windows and Apple Macintosh operating systems, among others. To
  support transportability, Excel writes BIFF files where the low-order
  byte of the word appears first in the file, followed by the highorder
  byte.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I understand that correctly (not sure that I do) big endian of the words are used, so that what I'm looking for is actually 2312(0908h). This makes the impression of being correct as it is found very early in every file i try.</p>

<p>So then over to the next step:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>4, Read the Globals substream, loading the BoundSheet8 records and the SST into memory. For more details, see Globals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I look for 133(8500h) and it's found shortly after BOF, good. But the problem lies in the two next steps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5, From the BoundSheet8 record that corresponds to the substream you want to open, read the first 4 bytes, which contains the lbPlyPos FilePointer.
  6, Go to the offset in the stream specified by the lbPlyPos FilePointer. This is the BOF record for the worksheet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the following 4 bytes is a pointer that points to a position in the file I should go to. But reading those bytes in any order gives me a number that is larger than the whole file. And also, this part confuses me: ""This is the BOF record for the worksheet."" Wasn't that what I found in an earlier step? Hmm...</p>

<p>Sorry for my rambling. And I hope I make sense and that someone would be willing to help me a little.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
Okay, I've gotten a little further with this. It's quite confusing to me but it seems that each record is also read as ""big endian"", ie the last variable in the record is the one that is positioned earliest in the file. Though I don't know if it applies to values with variable length? So, looking at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd773237%28v=office.12%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>, the values of variable length are listed as the last one in a record. But obviously they can't come as the first in the file because there would be no way to know how many bytes to read in if that info comes after it?
Anyway, if I ignore this value, and and skip 2 bytes for dt and A/unused and read the following 4 bytes as a uint it turns out as 1130 in my case. Adding that to the pos of the first BOF gives me the exact position of the sheet-BOF. And that cant be a coincidence, right?</p>

<p>Now the next problem arises. After that BOF-record the index-record is supposed to follow immediately. But no matter in what way I read in the bytes it still makes no sense...
Here's what it looks like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>09 08 10 00 00 06 10 00 BB 0D CC 07 00 00 00 00 06 00 00 00 00 02 0E
  00 00 00 00 00 1E 00 00 00 00 00 12 00 00 00 3E 02 12 00 B6 06 00 00
  00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 7D 00 0C 00 00 00 00 00 DD
  06 0F 00 00 00 00 00 7D 00 0C 00 02 00 02 00 DD 06 0F 00 00 00 00 00
  7D 00 0C 00 04 00 04 etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first 2 bytes there being the BOF record 09 08, or 0809 swapped which is 2057 (which represents BOF) so the rest should be the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd907627.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">INDEX</a> but doesn't make sense... I would greatly appreciate if someone could help me with this.</p>

801,NHibernate entity loose coupling,"<p>Let's say I have an entity called MyItem. It can be included in many ""parents"", like SomeCollection and SomeOtherCollection. Because it can be included in many parents, and since I don't want MyItem to know about the parents, I'd like to not have any properties in MyItem referencing a parent.</p>

<p>And since a parent, like SomeCollection, can contain many many MyItems, I feel like I need to have some sort of paging involved in getting the children from a parent. This would keep me from having a property in SomeCollection referencing MyItems. Lazy loaded or not, it's always ""all or nothing"" (right?).</p>

<p>I definitely need <em>some</em> reference between MyItem entities and their parents though, in the form of a mapping table in the database.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>How do I create mappings for this?
Can I have mappings, or should the
relation be kept in the business
logic instead?</li>
<li>How would I query
which MyItem entities exist in
SomeCollection? Can I do this with only one trip to the database using ICriteria?</li>

<p>note that it logs <code>""rendering""</code> when it should be rendering, so this method is getting called properly. </p>

%S = $remote_port - The port of the remote client.
%X = ? - Keep alive status.
%t = $time_local - The start time of the request.
%r = $request - The first line of request containing method verb, path and protocol.
%s = ? - Status before any redirections.
%&gt;s = $status - Status after any redirections.
%{pid}P = $pid - The process id.
%{tid}P = N/A - The thread id, which is non-applicable to Nignx.
%T = ? - The time in seconds to handle the request.
%D = $request_time - The time in milliseconds to handle the request.
%I = ? - The count of bytes received including headers. 
%O = $bytes_sent - The count of bytes sent including headers.
%B = $body_bytes_sent - The count of bytes sent excluding headers, but with a 0 for none instead of '-'.

<p>1) get sp_link* by sp_link_create_from_string(const char *$track_uri)</p>

<p>2) get sp_track* by sp_link_as_track(sp_link*)</p>

<p>3) sp_track_add_ref(sp_track*)</p>

<p>4) if sp_track_error() returns SP_ERROR_OK, or SP_ERROR_IS_LOADING but metadata_updated and SP_ERROR_OK then sp_session_player_load and sp_session_player_play to load and play the track.</p>

<p>5) sp_track_release() and sp_session_player_unload() when it's the end of track.</p>

<p>Now if user made a typo on the spotify track uri and tried to play <strong>spotify:track:5Z7ygHQo02SUrFmcgpwsKQ</strong> (the last character <strong>Q</strong> is a typo, should be <strong>W</strong>). All the possible error checks during the procedure don't return any error: </p>

<p>step 1) sp_link is not NULL</p>

<p>step 2) sp_track* is not NULL</p>

<p>step 3) returns SP_ERROR_OK</p>

<p>step 4) sp_track_error() returns SP_ERROR_IS_LOADING, metadata_updated never gets called, and of course the program hangs.</p>

<p>The checks before the track is loaded can't find out the invalidity of a track uri. The API <strong>sp_track_availability</strong> sounds like a way, but it will always return NOT AVAILABLE if the track is not loaded, but if the track uri is not correct, track will never be loaded.</p>

821,On the semantics of the gamma distribution,"<p>Good Morning.</p>

<p>I have recently been faced with modeling a quantity that is best modeled via a Gamma distribution. I have noticed that, in the characterization of the distribution via the parameters $k$ and $θ$, the mean of the distribution is $kθ$, whereas the ""top"" of the distribution, representing the point that is sampled with the highest probability, is found at point $θ( k - 1)$.</p>

<p>This contradicts my intuition. If the mean represents the expected value of the distribution, then why is it not placed at the ""top"" of the distribution, much like in the normal distribution?</p>

835,How to balance binary branches and repair shorthand triangles in LFG style c-trees using tikz-qtree,"<p>I have modified the example from the <code>tikz-qtree</code> documentation to form this LFG style c-tree, but am having difficulty balancing the binary branches in general, and the IP branches and roof/triangle DP 'the cat' in particular.</p>

<p>My question is how to control the vertical distance between each mother and daughter node so that branches can be made reasonably parallel to each other when comparing level to level? And how to fix the upside-down shorthand DP triangle, and also shorten the width of both triangles to better match the text width? Would very much appreciate suggestions.</p>

<p>@Alan Munn: Yes, exactly. I would prefer to have the DP of 'the cat' lined up horizontally with the VP just as you say. In general what I would like to do is to make the left branch from IP to DP shorter but parallel with the other leftwards branches: that is, parallel to VP to V-zero and PP to P-zero leftwards branch and ditto with all the rightwards branches. </p>

<p>I guess my question is: how do you shorten or lengthen each single branch of the c-tree from each mother node to each daughter node?</p>

<p>The code [inner xsep=0pt] etc. works well in reducing the width of the bottom line of the triangle: thank you for that. But the DP triangle 'the cat' is still upside down. Unfortunately I am not allowed to upload a jpg to this site of the c-tree as MikTeX produces it on my computer. It appears that having multiple levels of lines in each node in the style of LFG syntactic theory plays havoc with the binary branches. </p>

836,Sending images from Canvas elements using Ajax and PHP $_FILES,"<p>I need to be able to send an image and some form fields from a client side canvas element to a PHP script, ending up in $_POST and $_FILES. When I send it like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
var img = canvas.toDataURL(""image/png"");
...
ajax.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', ""multipart/form-data; boundary="" + boundary_str);
var request_body = boundary + '\n' 
+ 'Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""formfield""' + '\n' 
+ '\n' 
+ formfield + '\n' 
+ '\n' 
+ boundary + '\n'
+ 'Content-Disposition: form-data; name=""async-upload""; filename=""' 
+ ""ajax_test64_2.png"" + '""' + '\n' 
+ 'Content-Type: image/png' + '\n' 
+ '\n' 
+ img
+ '\n' 
+ boundary;
ajax.send(request_body);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>$_POST and $_FILES both come back populated, but the image data in $_FILES still needs decoding like this:</p>

<pre><code>$loc = $_FILES['async-upload']['tmp_name'];
$file = fopen($loc, 'rb');
$contents = fread($file, filesize($loc));
fclose($file);
$filteredData=substr($contents, strpos($contents, "","")+1);
$unencodedData=base64_decode($filteredData);
</code></pre>

<p>...in order to save it as a readable PNG. This isn't an option as I'm trying to pass the image to Wordpress's media_handle_upload() function, which requires an index to $_FILES pointing to a readable image. I also can't decode, save and alter 'tmp_name' accordingly, as it falls foul of security checks.</p>

<p>So, I found this:
<a href=""http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript-base64.html"">http://www.webtoolkit.info/javascript-base64.html</a>
and tried to do the decode on the client side:</p>

<pre><code>img_split = img.split("","",2)[1];
img_decoded = Base64.decode( img_split );
</code></pre>

<p>but for some reason I still don't end up with a readable file when it gets to the PHP.
So the question is: ""Why?"" or ""What am I doing wrong?"" or ""Is this even possible?"" :-)</p>

<p>Any help very much appreciated!</p>

841,How to prevent automated request?,"<p>I was wondering how to set up a system in which an authenticated user could send, with a simple graphical interaction (cliccking a button or so) a non-replayable request/message to the server from an application or a web page.
It's crytical there's must not be a way to set up an automated system that replaces user interaction automating the request as this would totally break up my entire project.
Moreover, as this action must be frequently repeated, it should not implement boring stuff like chaptas or so.</p>

<p>A pratical example: let's say the web page, shown after the login, displays a button that sends the server a request. How can I be sure the request was sent because the user actually clicked the button and it wasn't some sort of bot that forged the message?</p>

<p>Is that even possible to check? I'm sure it is and I'm quite sure there's must be some simple implementation I'm missing, and I'm sorry if this is a trivial question.
Also, if the solution is hiding ('cause I already searched a lot!) out there, please point me to it.</p>

<p>What conventions do you use for naming the ""non-exceptional"" method that the exceptional one will call?</p>

<p>As an example, this is a method I'm looking at:</p>

<pre><code>private void generateAndAttachDocumentFromTemplate(File templateFile) {
  try {
    File generatedDocument = generateDocumentFromTemplate(templateFile);
    if (generatedDocument != null) {
      attachDocument(generatedDocument, container);

      attachmentsPanel.reload();

      SystemControl.openDocument(generatedDocument);
    }
  } catch (Exception ex) {
    Notifier.notifyIT(App.user().getEmail(), ex);
    Dialogs.complain(""Can\'t Generate Document"");
  }
}

858,How do I reduce over 1000 links programatically in a jump menu?,"<p>Ok, so maybe my search syntax is wrong here, this could have very well been covered in stackoverflow but i've been unable to find anything after hours of searching.  Be warned, I am a novice developer when it comes to this type of stuff and would appreciate any guidance, help or pointers to accomplish the goal.  I'm open to suggestions of any type! :)</p>

<p>So, I have a site <a href=""http://www.animetip.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.animetip.com</a></p>

<p>On this site we have a popular feature called a ""jump menu"" which allows a user to quickly navigate directly to the page which contains the anime series they would like to see an episode in.  Essentially we have every series on the site (over 1000) broken down in an a-z list.  When a user hovers over a letter, the menu will drop down and display all series that begin with that letter.  A user can then go to the series they'd like to view and click on it to go directly to the page. </p>

<p>The issue with this is SEO.  We are being penalized due to the number of links on the page.  What we need to accomplish is the same (or better) functionality while reducing the links loaded in the page.  If we could come up with a way to create the menu and have the link itself not be served until its clicked on I believe that would resolve the issue.</p>

<p>What is the best strategy for doing this?  I am no expert by any means, but I was thinking that putting all the links in mySQL and then calling the link as its clicked would be ok, but a friend cautioned me that it would cause a performance hit. I have also reviewed material which indicates you can do the same thing using an array to store the links and then call them as they are needed using PHP.  I grasp the concept of doing that but could use a stub type example to get me started.</p>

<p>The site is built on Wordpress with a completely custom template / theme.</p>

<p>Someone has commented that the topic wasn't researched.  Unfortunately I've spent lots of time researching it, the problem is that I think I'm using the wrong terminology to describe what I need to find.  If anyone would care to give me the terminology or a good place to conduct further research (even a few keywords!) I will be MORE than happy to go do that.</p>

<p>Thank you for any help or tips to information I can learn from!  </p>

860,Entity Framework 4.1 Integration Unit Tests,"<p>First, a few caveats:</p>

<p>We are building a small/medium sized system that is anticipated to have a lifespan of 2-5 years (relatively short). The system is being developed with Entity Framework 4.1, Code First, MVC3. We are trying to push our team towards unit testing / TDD. It is something that we have not done, but we recognize its value so are taking baby steps in that direction. </p>

<p>With all of that in mind, we have decided to build unit tests with Visual Studio 2010's built-in testing framework. We are NOT using the repository pattern or mocks. This is to reduce the complexity and time spent building the unit tests. Each unit test is really more of an integration test - we have a 'test' database that gets initialized each time the tests are run, and each test uses the same controllers that the views use to get as close as we can to real-world behavior of the system.</p>

<p>When commenting or answering this question, <em>please do not attack this approach</em>. I am well aware that this is not TDD in its purest form nor is it the ideal pattern for testing units of work. We are doing it this way to get our feet wet with the technology and try to get the most bang for our buck in terms of time spent building the unit tests.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>

<p>We are building a lot of unit tests that store an object via a controller, then retrieve the object from the database through the controller to verify that it was stored correctly and that it comes back through our controller the way we would expect. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void Edit_Post_Saves_OperatingCompany_In_DB_When_OperatingCompany_Is_Valid()
{   
    OperatingCompany opco = new OperatingCompany();
    opco.Name = ""OpCo - Edit Post - Valid - DB Save"";
    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();
    controller.Create(opco);

    Guid opcoid = opco.Id;

    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();
    opco = (OperatingCompany) ((ViewResult)controller.Edit(opcoid)).Model;
    opco.Name = ""Edit - OpCo - Edit Post - Valid - DB Save"";

    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();
    HelperMethods.AddValidationResultsToModelState(opco, controller);
    controller.Edit(opco);

    controller = new OperatingCompanyController();
    ViewResult result = controller.Index();

    Assert.IsTrue(((IEnumerable&lt;OperatingCompany&gt;)result.Model).Contains(opco));
}
</code></pre>

<p>The error we are getting is this: </p>

<p><strong>Test method WebObjects.Tests.Controllers.OperatingCompanyControllerTest.Edit_Post_Saves_OperatingCompany_In_DB_When_OperatingCompany_Is_Valid threw exception: 
System.InvalidOperationException: An entity object cannot be referenced by multiple instances of IEntityChangeTracker.</strong></p>

<p>I am pretty sure this is occuring because the entity in question isn't being detached from the context of the first controller, and when we reinstantiate it and try to edit the same entity, it thinks another context still has ahold of it. The reason we are reinstantiating the controller is to ensure that the entity is being pulled back from the database and not just being returned from the cache of the DbContext (please correct me if I am wrong here, but I believe that is what would be happening if we didn't reinstantiate).</p>

<p>We were able to get this to work by explicitly detaching every object from the context after every call to SaveChanges as well as detaching when we query objects via the context in our controllers, but I don't want to do that just to get our unit tests to work, plus I am sure it would be a significant performance hit. </p>

<p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>

<p>Is there some better way to perform this type of integration test with our controllers?</p>

861,Does it still make sense to think about effective code on micro scale in C++?,"<p>Early in my programming career I was in love with pointer twiddling, lean code, doing everything with as little layers of abstraction as possible and so on. The code was very C like I would say, close to metal and clever.</p>

<p>Time has passed, I have a lot more experience, and I'm noticing my attitude towards the code has changed.</p>

<p>And with changed, I mean, I don't want to bother about everyday stuff anymore, unless it's super easy to do.</p>

<p>If there is a string concatenation, I will never choose raw pointers deliberately. If I need to concatenate stuff, I might add a quick guess reserve for an STL container, but I don't want to bother with preallocated buffers, C like APIs, caches, avoiding hitting the disk, or trashing. I know realloc might happen from time to time, including all the heap locks, extra copying and so on, but I don't even bother anymore.</p>

<p>Maybe, it is because I have spent some time early in my career where I thought of a clean and beautiful schemes with worker threads that process large amount of trivial data, only to find out later that the whole unoptimized realloc+copy+realloc+copy+realloc+copy+5 layers of wrappers doesn't even register in profiler.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because I've seen how compilers sometimes do magic.</p>

<p>However, such trivial things do add up. When all your code base uses higher order constructs, it has chances that there will be some realloc all over the place, or cold disk hits, that can cause a general perception of a slow application.</p>

<p>Sort of like WTL vs MFC. Or how you instantly know that the application is written in Java when you launch it.</p>

<p>But is it really? Is there any comparisons of software that's using only very lean and smart code vs software that uses generic containers all over the place?</p>

<p>Would you even feel a difference if the string allocation throughout the program would be using prereserves and smart moves vs lazily calling string.append in every place where there is a need for such functionality?</p>

<p>Do you try to implement mitigation solutions for such simple, well known things that are cheap to execute anyway?</p>

<p>Can software turn into bloatware just because extra caution is not applied to every line of code?</p>

862,Pixel-perfect vertical alignment of image-rendered TeX snippets?,"<p>What is the most accurate way to automatically calculate the text baseline in an image that has been rendered from a TeX snippet—so that the rendered image can be given proper vertical alignment in a block of text?</p>

<p><strong>My current approach (which isn’t working in all cases):</strong></p>

<p>Here’s an example of what I’m trying to do.  Note that these are <em>screenshots of a web page</em> (HTML + CSS + Latin Modern fonts for web) and <em>not of a TeX document</em>.  The web page is mostly paragraphs of text, but contains embedded PNG images (rendered TeX snippets) for the formulas involving square roots.  Here’s how I want it to look:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/XFuhS.png"" alt=""big good""></p>

<p>But here’s what I’m getting...</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/kjSt6.png"" alt=""big bad""></p>

<p>The second—the smaller—square root formula is aligned correctly, and it was done automatically.  I’m calculating the baseline by first rendering a snippet consisting of only a “.” character, and then by measuring the height of the resulting image, after cropping away everything below the “.”, this tells me how much I need to lower the image (using CSS’s <code>vertical-align</code> style) in order to align it with the surrounding text’s baseline.  This works well for formulas that aren’t too tall.</p>

<p>Where it fails is, well, taller formulas, as shown above. In the case of the first—the larger—square root formula, it needs to be lowered less than normal, because it extends higher than normal.  My calculations for this are currently wrong, and I’m wondering how I can fix this.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives?</strong></p>

<p>What are some ways of measuring the baseline (in pixels) of a snippet?  I can’t really use <code>\documentclass{standalone}</code> for this because it crops the page as tightly as possible, which produces different image heights for <code>$x$</code>, <code>$X$</code>, and <code>\sqrt{x}</code>.  I’m thinking I may need to render a calibration snippet consisting of two blank lines prior to a lone <code>.</code> (or perhaps a bottom-aligned horizontal rule) instead of just a single <code>.</code> character—but that seems a bit kludgey.</p>

<p>Is there a way to coax TeX into not placing a formula lower on the page when it is taller than standard text?  That is, is there some way I can cause a formula at the top of a page to protrude upward into the top margin?</p>

<p><strong>A second problem</strong></p>

<p>I also noticed that I’m seeing sub-pixel alignment problems.  Below are screenshots scaled up to 400% actual size:  This formula is ¾ pixel too low:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YJEjT.png"" alt=""too low""></p>

<p>At first, I thought I was calculating the <code>vertical-align</code> value wrong, so I manually moved it up by one pixel, but then it turns out that it's ¼ pixel too high—which means the problem lies within the image rather than the alignment value:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5KkSK.png"" alt=""too high""></p>

<p>I suspect this is fixable by making sure I round the image heights up to the nearest multiple of 4 before I downsample them for embedding in the page.  Just wondering if anyone has tackled this problem before, and has any tips.  I’m encouraged by these results so far, but doing this correctly turns out to be a lot more subtle than I expected it would be.  Naïvely, when I first started this, I hadn’t considered tall formulas or even vertical alignment at all.</p>

882,How to pick base samples deterministically in the particle filter algorithm?,"<p>The particle filter algorithm is known for its use in tracking objects in a video sequence: at each iteration, the algorithm generates hypotheses (or samples) about the motion of the object. In order to generate a new hypothesis, the first step of the condensation algorithm involves the selection of a sample: the example, provided in <a href=""http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~misard/download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this web page</a>, shows an implementation of the selection step, which uses the binary search in order to pick a base sample; the comment in support of the <code>pick_base_sample()</code> function explains that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The use of this routine makes Condensation O(NlogN) where N is the number of samples. It is probably better to pick base samples
  deterministically, since then the algorithm is O(N) and probably
  marginally more efficient, but this routine is kept here for
  conceptual simplicity and because it maps better to the published
  literature.</em></p>

I am working on a project where I will need a GUI/Canvas (still confused on the difference) that has three frames I guess. Basically it is an elevator project where on either side of the canvas there is a rectangular elevator object, and in the middle are buttons (stacked on top of each other) that are used to represent floors (so if you click on the button, the elevator moves to the same row as the button). I am stuck on how you would design the canvas for this. I have had some ideas regarding gridLayout and broderLayouts, but it is all a jumbled mess right now. </p>

895,javascript counter - immediately implement comma on page load,"<p>I have a javascript counter (that works beautifully) and have now added commas, which works too.  The commas show up, BUT it only shows when the counter increments.  It's actually 4 counters and a total counter. 3 of the counters increment so often that it's not a problem, but I need the commas to show up on page load as there is a background and not just when the counter increments.  I think it has to do with where I call the addCommas(), but can't get it working when I call it differently.  I'll throw in some of the code:</p>

<pre><code>var crate_msInterval = crate_interval * 1000;

crate_count = parseInt((now - start_date)/crate_msInterval) * increment + start_value;

document.getElementById('crate_counter').innerHTML = crate_count;
setInterval(""crate_count += increment; document.getElementById('crate_counter').innerHTML = addCommas(crate_count);"", crate_msInterval);
</code></pre>

<p>And then the commas function I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>function addCommas(str){
   var arr,int,dec;
   str += '';

   arr = str.split('.');
   int = arr[0] + '';
   dec = arr.length&gt;1?'.'+arr[1]:'';

   return int.replace(/(\d)(?=(\d{3})+$)/g,""$1,"") + dec;
}

896,Even id values. Tricky sequence mapping (grails oracle),"<p>I'm writing a webapp in grails, and for the first time with oracle underneath. Every table has id generated from sequence and I'm setting id using trigger before insert as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE  ""RECIPE"" 
   (    ""ID"" NUMBER(19,0) NOT NULL ENABLE, 
    ...
     PRIMARY KEY (""ID"") ENABLE
   )
/

 CREATE SEQUENCE   ""RECIPE_SEQ""  MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 999999999999999999999999999 INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1 CACHE 20 NOORDER  NOCYCLE
/

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER  ""BI_RECIPE"" 
  before insert on ""RECIPE""               
  for each row  
begin   
    select ""RECIPE_SEQ"".nextval into :NEW.ID from dual; 
end; 
/
</code></pre>

<p>I also made mapping</p>

<pre><code>static mapping = {
        table 'RECIPE'
        version false        
        id column:'ID', generator:'sequence', params:[sequence:'RECIPE_SEQ']
        ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now during inserting a domain object it always has an even id value. I found out that the even ids are produced because grails gets an id value from sequence and later during real inserting to the db trigger gets an id value from sequence again and overrides those given by grails.</p>

<p>And what to do with this? The best solution for me would be oracle working like mysql with identity key generation strategy. Can anybody share some opinion with me?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT (solution)</strong>: According to the Randy's answer it's enough to add a condition in the trigger like below:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER  ""BI_RECIPE"" 
  before insert on ""RECIPE""               
  for each row  
begin
    if :NEW.ID IS NULL then
        select ""RECIPE_SEQ"".nextval into :NEW.ID from dual; 
    end if;
end; 
/

897,How to get field data with $_POST from php form builder class 2.3,"<p>I am using the PHP FORM BUILDER CLASS latest version 2.3</p>

<p>In the previous versions 1.x it used phpmailer/google mail to submit form, this is not in use now.</p>

<p>I have managed to get the form to call a PHP file to action when it validates </p>

<p>(just by calling it in validation <code>if</code> statement)</p>

<pre><code>header(""Location: process.php""); 
</code></pre>

<p>However, my issue is in my PHP file I call to action, I usually declare variables using <code>$_POST</code> and refer to the form field ID, e.g. below for unique form field ID <code>FName</code></p>

<pre><code>$fname  = $_POST['FName'];
</code></pre>

<p>Then I can envoke a mail function and or some MySQL to insert into database.</p>

<p>However currently this is just resulting in blank informatio so assumably I don't have the right ID for the fields or I need to use a different function.</p>

<p>So Question is how to you submit data gathered from forms created with PHP Form Builder Class newer 2.x version</p>

902,jQuery AJAX mangling character enoding on the way to the server,"<p>I have looked through several question about AJAX and character encoding, but I can only seem to find questions about the response's encoding, but not where the data sent to the server's encoding.</p>

<p>I am sending a form serialized using jQuery to the server. PHP then saves this form's fields to a database. The database uses latin1-swedish-ci. The page with the form uses iso-8859-1.</p>

<p>When I do this by using AJAX to send the data to the server, characters like <code>“</code> get converted to <code>â€œ</code> on the way to the server, and get saved in the database as such. When I skip the AJAX and use a normal html form submit, the characters turn out fine in the database.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the jQuery serialization of the form data and the AJAX submission are what's causing the characters to get mangled, but how can I fix this? I have tried changing the contentType of the AJAX call. I have tried using <code>iconv()</code> to convert the characters server side, which causes errors or incorrect translations. I have tried to use <code>utf8_decode()</code> server side, but this converts it into a question mark. I cannot change the output pages to UTF-8 encoding, because this causes other problems with other content on these pages. Ideally the solution would prevent the characters from being saved in the database wrong in the first place, as would happen with a normal html form submit. Any ideas on how to solve this?</p>

<p>javascript that sends the form to the server:</p>

<pre><code>BlogEditForm.prototype.save = function() {

  width = parseInt(document.getElementById(""character"").style.width);
  height = parseInt(document.getElementById(""character"").style.height);

  newx = evt.pageX - width/2;
  newy = evt.pageY - height/2;

  disx = newx - oldx;
  disy = newy - oldy;

  diag = parseInt(Math.sqrt(disx*disx + disy*disy));

  speed = 50;

  secs = diag/speed;

  pxsecx = disx/secs;
  pxsecy = disy/secs;

<p>Has anyone else seen this and maybe knows of a way of clearing the cache so that the boost unit test framework will not report a memory leak?</p>

<p>The details for my problem are :-</p>

<pre><code>ICU version 4.6.0
(Built using supplied vs2010 solution in debug and release configuration)
Boost version 1.45
(built with command ""bjam variant=debug,release threading=multi link=shared stage"" since standard distribution does not include icu support in regex)
OS Windows 7
Compiler MSVC 10 (Visual Studio 2010 Premium)
</code></pre>

<p>Though I did try this with a boost 1.42 with icu 4.2.1 which I happened to have built on my system with same results so don't think its a problem which would be solved by changing to boost 1.47 icu 4.8.1 which are the latest versions.</p>

<p>Compiling the following code (Test.cpp) :-</p>

<pre><code>#define BOOST_TEST_MAIN    //Ask boost unit test framework to create a main for us
#define BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK //Ask boost to link to dynamic library rather than purely header support where appropriate
#include &lt;boost/test/auto_unit_test.hpp&gt;

#include &lt;boost/regex.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;boost/regex/icu.hpp&gt; //We use icu extensions to regex to support unicode searches on utf-8
#include &lt;unicode/uclean.h&gt;    //We want to be able to clean up ICU cached objects

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE( standard_regex ) 
{
    boost::regex re( ""\\d{3}"");
}

BOOST_AUTO_TEST_CASE( u32_regex ) 
{
    boost::u32regex re( boost::make_u32regex(""\\d{3}""));
    u_cleanup(); //Ask the ICU library to clean up any cached memory
}

<p>Which can be compiled from a command line by:-</p>

<pre><code>C:\&gt;cl test.cpp /I[BOOST HEADERS PATH] /I[ICU HEADERS] /EHsc /MDd -link /LIBPATH:[BOOST LIB PATH] [ICU LIB PATH]icuuc.lib
</code></pre>

<p>With the appropriate paths to headers / libs for your machine</p>

<p>Copy the appropriate boost dlls to the directory containing test.exe if they are not pathed in (boost_regex-vc100-mt-gd-1_45.dll and boost_unit_test_framework-vc100-mt-gd-1_45.dll)</p>

<p>I'm guessing that icu is actually the culprit here since there it has its name at the start of the 2nd block.</p>

<p>Just doing the 1st test (ie just creating a standard regex not a u32_regex) has no memory leaks detected.</p>

<p>Adding multiple u32_regex's to the test does not result in more memory being leaked.</p>

<p>I attempted to clean up the icu cache by using the u_cleanup() call as per the <a href=""http://userguide.icu-project.org/design"" rel=""nofollow"">icu documentation</a> see the ICU Initialization and Termination section.</p>

<p>However I am not very familiar with the icu library (actually am only using it because we wanted unicode aware regex support) and can't see how to get the u_cleanup() call to actually clean up the data when ICU is being loaded by the boost regex dll.</p>

<p>Just to reiterate the problem appears to be :-</p>

<p>boost regex in a dll compiled with optional icu support (I'm pretty sure this uses a static link to icu but may be wrong here)</p>

<p>If I link to icuuc.lib in test program so that I can call u_cleanup() this doesn't appear to affect the memory held by the instance of ICU loaded via the boost regex library (well it would be rather odd if it did)</p>

<p>I can't find any calls in regex library which allow me to ask it to cleanup the ICU data which is really where we want to make the call.</p>

912,server-side caching strategy for user filtered results,"<p>I have a situation at <a href=""http://www.zipstory.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.zipstory.com</a> (beta) where I have n-permutations of feeds coming from the same database. For example, someone can get a feed for whatever city they are interested in and as many of these cities all together so its all sorted by most recent or most votes.</p>

<p>How should I cache things for each user without completely maxing out the available memory when there are thousands of users at the same time?</p>

<p>My only guess is don't. I could come up with a client-side caching strategy where I sort out the cities results but this way I could still cache in a one-size fits all strategy by city.</p>

<p>What approaches do you suggest? I'm in unfamiliar ground at this point and could use a good strategy. I noticed this website does not do that but Facebook does. They must be pulling from a pool of cached user-feeds and plucking them in client-side. Not sure, again I'm not smart enough to figure this out just yet.</p>

<p>In other words...</p>

<p>Each city has its own feed. Each user has an n-permutation of city feeds combined.</p>

<p>I would like to see possible solutions to this problem using c# and ASP.NET</p>

<hr>

<p>Adding to this Febuary 28th, 2013. Here's what I did based on your comments so THANKS!...</p>

<ul>
<li>For every user logging in, I cache their preferred city list</li>
<li>The top 10 post results are cached per city and stored in a Linq based object</li>
<li>When a user comes in and has x cities as feeds, I go through their city list loop then check if city postings are in cache, if not, I get from DB then populate the individual posting's html into cache along with other sorting elements.</li>
<li>I recombine the list of cities into one feed for the user and since i have some sorting elements on the linq object, i can resort them in the proper order and give back to the user</li>
</ul>

<p>This does mean there is some CPU work everytime regardless as I have to combine city lists into a single city list but this avoids going to the database every time and everyone benefits in faster page response times. The main drawback is since I'm not doing a single query UNION on cities before, this requires a single query per city if each was not cached but each city is checked if cached or not individually so 10 queries per 10 cities would only happen if the site is a dead zone.</p>

<pre><code>android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION""
android:name=""android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION""

<p>Despite this, the GeoLocation section of Flurry only reveals country location of use:</p>

<pre><code>United Kingdom          127          100.0% 
Vatican City            0            0.0%

Switzerland             0            0.0%

<p>Prior to adding the above permissions, the ""Detailed Location"" section was unavailable. After adding either one of the above permissions the ""Detailed Location"" section became available; but <strong>all</strong> city fields show ""0; 0.0%"":</p>

<pre><code>York                    0            0.0% 
Wolverhampton           0            0.0%

926,Copying non-existent resources during iPhone build,"<p>At one point in my iPhone app development, I had 2 rather large video files as resources for use in the app. After some tests, I decided I didn't want them anymore. So I deleted both from the resources folder in xcode - and I selected 'remove and delete selected references.' When I try to build on my iPhone or iPad, it still says ""copying file opening.mov to iPhone."" And it takes up space in the build. </p>

<p>What is happening? I deleted all references to the file everywhere on my computer, but it still copies the file on my iDevices. </p>

<p>I can't really see a logical reason for this, and consider my self reasonably conscious of good programming practice. I think they are useful for straight forward data management and help to avoid excessive stored procedure numbers.</p>

937,Using AddEncoding x-gzip .gz without actual files,"<p>With Apache (2.2 and later) how can I achieve the following. I want to transparently compress using GZip encoding (<em>not</em> plain Deflate) the output when a certain file is queried with its name plus the extension <code>.gz</code>, where the <code>.gz</code> version doesn't physically exist on disk.</p>

<p>So let's say I have a file named <code>/path/foo.bar</code> and <em>no</em> file <code>foo.bar.gz</code> in the folder to which the URI <code>/path</code> maps, how can I get Apache to serve the contents of <code>/path/foo.bar</code> but with <code>AddEncoding x-gzip ...</code> applied to the (non-existing) file?</p>

<p>The rewrite part appears to be easy, but the problem is how to apply the encoding to a non-existent item. The other way around also seems to be simple as long as the client supports the encoding.</p>

<p>Is the only solution really a script that does this on the fly?</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm aware of <code>mod_deflate</code> and <code>mod_gzip</code> and it is <em>not</em> what I'm looking for - at least not alone. In particular I need an actual GZIP file and not just a deflated stream.</p>

<p>Now I was thinking of using mod_ext_filter, but couldn't bridge the gap between rewriting the name of the (non-existent) <code>file.gz</code> to <code>file</code> on one side and the <code>LocationMatch</code> on the other. Here's what I have.</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.*?\.ext)\.gz$ $1 [L]
ExtFilterDefine gzip mode=output cmd=""/bin/gzip""
&lt;LocationMatch ""/my-files/special-path/.*?\.ext\.gz""&gt;
    AddType application/octet-stream .ext.gz
    SetOutputFilter gzip
    Header set Content-Encoding gzip
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the header for <code>Content-Encoding</code> isn't really needed by the clients in this case. They expect to see actual GZIP files, but I want to do this on-the-fly without caching (this is a test scenario).</p>

941,Custom Control in iPhone Interface Builder,"<p>This appears to be a common question, but I haven't seen it answered clearly or succinctly - and as such I'm having trouble making it work. </p>

<p>I have created a Widget.xib file in Interface Builder. It consists of:</p>

<pre><code>View (UIView)
  ImageView (UIImageView)
  Button (UIButton)
  Label (UILabel)
</code></pre>

<p>I have created Widget.h and Widget.m, which implement class Widget, which derives from UIView. In Interface Builder, Widget.xib has its File's Owner set to the Widget class.</p>

<p>Widget.h looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>@interface IconView : UIView {
IBOutlet UIButton *widgetButton;
IBOutlet UILabel *widgetLabel;
IBOutlet UIView *widgetView;
IBOutlet UIImageView *widgetImage;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIButton *widgetButton;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UILabel *widgetLabel;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIView *widgetView;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIImageView *widgetImage;
</code></pre>

<p>Widget.h includes:</p>

<pre><code>@synthesize widgetButton, widgetLabel, widgetView, widgetImage;
</code></pre>

<p>And its dealloc releases those four objects. In Interface Builder, the button, label, view, and imageview are all connected to the appropriate IBOutlets.</p>

<p>Back in Interface Builder, I've opened another XIB from the project. This is Playfield.xib. It's a more traditional view, backed with PlayfieldViewController.h and .m. It contains:</p>

<pre><code>View (UIView)
  ImageView (with a static graphic) (UIImageView)
  Button (UIButton)
  Widget
  Widget
  Widget
</code></pre>

<p>In Playfield.h, I've created IBOutlets for the button and the three Widgets.</p>

<pre><code>@interface LinkViewController : UIViewController {
IBOutlet UIButton *buttonBack;
IBOutlet Widget *widget0;
IBOutlet Widget *widget1;
IBOutlet Widget *widget2;
}

@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet Widget *widget0;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet Widget *widget1;
@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet Widget *widget2;
- (IBAction)buttonBackClicked:(id)sender;
</code></pre>

<p>These are also synthesized and released in Playfield.h. In Interface Builder, Playfield.xib shows three empty rectangles where the widgets have been placed, which is what I expected. Those are wired up to their corresponding IBOutlets in Playfield.h.</p>

<p>So, at this point I assume everything is ready to go. In Playfield.m's viewDidLoad, I do this:</p>

<p>self.widget0.label.text = @""Feed Me"";</p>

<p>In my mind, that references the widget0 IBOutlet declared in Playfield.h. That connects to the first Widget item in Playfield.xib. That, in turn, has a declared label IBOutlet in Widget.xib and Widget.h. A UILabel has a Text property. So it should change the text on the label within the widget.</p>

<p>But it doesn't. What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>(I want to emphasize that I'm not looking to make an Interface Builder plugin. I know those are complicated. Within IB, I'm fine manipulating my Widgets as empty rectangles. I'll also note that I've set the background color for the widget's View, in Widget.xib, to white. When I run the project, I can clearly see the white rectangles atop the playfield graphic, so I know the widgets are ""in"" there. I just can't seem to access them.)</p>

947,Which headers should I use for serving static content?,"<p>I am gzipping my static Javascript and CSS files using PHP. When the original file is requested, the server sends the <code>Last-Modified</code> and <code>ETag</code> headers. I'm not sending these with PHP just yet. I've also seen suggestions to use <code>Cache-control</code> and <code>Expires</code> headers and some more that I don't remember.</p>

<p>Are those first two enough? I guess I can get the last modified date quite easily with PHP, but how would I generate an ETag?</p>

<p>If it's better to include the other two, what's the best way to attach those to other files like images? Maybe through <code>.htaccess</code>? (I don't have direct access to the server.)</p>

952,Extend .NET TreeView CheckBox,"<p>I have a .NET TreeView control with checkboxes on the leaves. I want to be able to get the value of the node when a checkbox is selected. Basically, this is a tree of email contacts and when the user selects a checkbox I want to pull the node value (email address) and place that in a text box. The second part is no problem, I'll just call a JS function to append the email to the text box. </p>

<p>So, the issue is how to extract the node's value from the checkbox with JS. Unless someone has an alternate method, I was thinking about extending the TreeView to not include a normal checkbox but rather one that can store a value. Note: I have an existing control called CheckBoxValue that will do exactly this. Fundamentally, my question is how can I extend the TreeView to include this? I believe this would be in the CreateChildControls method but would love some help.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<pre><code>User.objects.create(username=str(random.random()), email='Foo')

</code></pre>

<p>The only problems is that the <code>DEFAULT NULL</code> does not seem to work: <code>User.objects.create(username=str(random.random()))</code> creates a user with an empty-string email.</p>

<p>However, in a unit-test, I believe something is going on that prevents the post-syncdb hook from working:</p>

<pre><code>class DjangoUserTest(TestCase):

    def test_unique_nullable_email(self):
        import IPython; IPython.embed()
        u1 = User.objects.create(username=""u1"", email=None)
        u2 = User.objects.create(username=""u2"", email=None)

<p>I can drop into the ipython shell and see that the table has been apparently modified:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: from django.db import connection

In [2]: c = connection.cursor()

In [3]: r = c.execute(""select `sql` from sqlite_master WHERE tbl_name = 'auth_user';"")

In [4]: r.fetchall()

 (None,),
 (u'CREATE UNIQUE INDEX auth_user_email_unique ON auth_user (email COLLATE NOCASE)',)]

<p>However, upon trying to do the creates, I get, <code>IntegrityError: auth_user.email may not be NULL</code>.  How did this happen when the <code>select sql from sqlite_master WHERE tbl_name = 'auth_user';</code> clearly says <code>""email"" varchar(75) DEFAULT NULL</code>. I feel like I just need to commit the post_syncdb stuff or sth. Any ideas?</p>

<p>UPDATE: No amount of <code>connection.commit()</code>, <code>cursor.close()</code> helps, using <code>TransactionTestCase</code> does not help.</p>

If I want to achieve better performance from, let's say for example, MySQLdb, I can compile it myself and I will get better performance because it's not compiled on i386, i486 or what ever, just on my CPU. Further I can choose the compile options and so on...
Now, I was wondering if this is true also for non-regular Software, such as compiler. 
Here come the 1st part: </p>

<ul>
<li>Will compiling a compiler like GCC result in better performance ?
and the 2nd part:</li>
<li>Will the code compiled by my own compiled compiler perform better ?</li>

<p>I'm trying to make a small game, using SDL. When an entity is created, its image should up the refcount, and that's no problem. The problem comes when it's time to use ""SDL_FreeSurface(image)"" (do decrease it), this should happen within the entity itself so I'm trying to create my own destructor, as a test to see if it got called at all I added a cout, but it's called every tick for some reason? It's not deleting anything so I suppose I also have to take care of all the entities values when I do get it to work (thought that I only had to take care of the special cases, such as this).</p>

<p>So could anyone provide me with a solution? Thanks in advance.</p>

992,How often does random.randint generate the same number?,"<p>I want to generate random integers between 0-9 (inclusive on both ends), but I want to make sure it doesn't often generate the same number consecutively. I plan to use the <code>randint</code> function from the <code>random</code> module. But I'm not sure if it will be handy. How often does <code>random.randint</code> generate the same number?</p>

993,\dotfill linebreak problem,"<p>I am generating an address book in XeTeX and found a problem I cannot solve. So an address book is a list of Names, addresses and number split in columns. Ideally, one entry should look like this (underscores represent space):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Name.........Number</p>
  
  <p>Address_<em>_</em>__Number2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had no problem achieving this layout, there is only a small problem when name is to long and splits into more lines, then it should look something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Long nameeeeeeeeeeee</p>
  
  <p>more name .......Number</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Long  nameeeeeeeee</p>
  
  <p>...............Number</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first one is also not a problem, but second one gives me headaches. It turns out like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Long nameeeeeee</p>
  
  <p>Number</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are no dots...</p>

I do not have ISP connection rather i have fixed IP connectivity so that i get a 100Mbps ethernet cable coming for switch with fixed static IP Address which previously i was connecting directly to my laptop and it was working perfectly.  </p>

<p>Now with this new router, i setup everything, configured WAN settings and plugged the cable that i plugged to my laptop. It works but...  </p>

<p>Every time i open a webpage, it takes forever to open or might be some part of page loads and then it just hangs in a waiting state.<br>
Things do not change no matter i use it over wireless or secondary wired port (LAN).  </p>

<p>Is there some specific settings that i should do here to make it work?  </p>

<p>Considering i have IP Connectivity at backend, would that require some specific settings?<br>
I googled and something tells me about MTU but not sure if i should mingle with it, any suggestions??</p>

   A(const std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&amp;);

1001,Bazaar offline + branches,"<p>I have a Bazaar repository on Host A with multiple branches. This is my main repository.</p>

<p>Until now, I have been doing checkouts on my other machines and committing directly to the main repository. However, now I am consolidating all my work to my laptop and multiple VMs. I need to be working offline regularly. In particular, I need to create/delete/merge branches all while offline.</p>

<p>I was thinking of continuing to have the master on Host A with a clone of the repository on the laptop with each vms doing checkouts of the clone.</p>

<p>Then, when I go offline, I could do bzr unbind on the clone and bzr bind when I am back online.</p>

<p>This failed as soon as I tried to bzr clone since bzr clone only clones a branch(!!!!)</p>

<p>I need some serious help. If Hg would handle this better please let me know (I need Windows support.) However, at this moment I cannot switch from Bazaar as it is too close to some important deadlines.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
